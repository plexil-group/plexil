Bugs
----

Redisplay still not always happening when it should
 - plan views not "live", even when front window
  [FIXED! was problem with changing hash code]
 - variable display in node info window; strangely, condition view works.
  [in progress; found part of problem, not completely solved yet]

Debug file in settings window
 - if 'none' selected, need to make it stick somehow between settings [done]

Occasional hang on exit, usually if execution paused or (once) with multiple plan views


Restore Features
----------------

Breakpoints
 - Need to pause execution when state update received, NOT when displayed
 - 

New Features
------------

Single-step display independently of execution
 - Reimplement execution breakpoints
 - Implement display breakpoints

New breakpoints:
 - on condition change
 - on assignment (was this already implemented?)

Recent items history
 - 'Load recent' menu item
 - Restore settings if plan file in history
 - Save history at shutdown


Performance
-----------

Console display sluggish with large amounts of output


UI changes
----------

Menu item accelerators appropriate to platform (ctrl-X vs cmd-X)

Only application-wide status should be shown in console status bar

Monitoring external apps - much to sort out
