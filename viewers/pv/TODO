Features
--------

Single-step display independently of execution
 - Reimplement execution breakpoints
 - Implement display breakpoints

New breakpoints:
 - on condition change
 - on assignment (is this already implemented?)

Recent items history
 - 'Load recent' menu item
 - Restore settings if plan file in history
 - Save history at shutdown


Bugs
----

Redisplay still not always happening when it should
 - plan views not "live", even when front window
 - variable display in node info window; strangely, condition view works.


Performance
-----------

Console display sluggish with large amounts of output


UI changes
----------

Menu item accelerators appropriate to platform (ctrl-X vs cmd-X)

Only application-wide status should be shown in console status bar

Monitoring external apps - much to sort out
