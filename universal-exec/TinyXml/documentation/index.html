 <h1> TinyXml </h1>
<p>
TinyXml is a simple, small, C++ XML parser that can be easily  integrating into other programs.
<p>
<h2> What it does. </h2>

<p>
In brief, TinyXml parses an XML document, and builds from that a  Document Object Model (DOM) that can be read, modified, and saved.
<p>
XML stands for "eXtensible Markup Language." It allows you to create  your own document markups. Where HTML does a very good job of marking  documents for browsers, XML allows you to define any kind of document  markup, for example a document that describes a "to do" list for an  organizer application. XML is a very structured and convenient format. All those random file formats created to store application data can  all be replaced with XML. One parser for everything.
<p>
There are different ways to access and interact with XML data. TinyXml uses a Document Object Model (DOM), meaning the XML data is parsed into a tree objects that can be browsed and manipulated, and then  written back to disk. You can also construct an XML document from scratch with C++ objects and write this to disk (or another output stream.)
<p>
TinyXml is designed to be easy and fast. It is two headers and four cpp  files. Simply add these to your project and off you go. There is an  example to get you started. It is released under the ZLib license,  so you can use it in open source or commercial code.
<p>
It attempts to be a flexible parser, but with truly correct and compliant XML output (with the exception of the character set, below.) TinyXml should compile on any reasonably C++ system. It does not rely on exceptions or RTTI. It can be  compiled with or without STL support.
<p>
<h2> What it doesn't do. </h2>

<p>
It doesnt parse or use DTDs (Document Type Definitions) or XSLs (eXtensible Stylesheet Language.) It is only tested on Latin-1  characters (which is the Western European character set).  Although people have reported success in passing through Latin-1  and UTF-8 data. There are other parsers out there (check out www.sourceforge.org, search for XML) that are much more fully featured. But they are also much bigger, take longer to set up in your project, have a higher learning curve, and often have a more restrictive license. If you are working with browsers or have more complete XML needs, TinyXml is not the parser for you.
<p>
<h2> Code Status. </h2>

<p>
TinyXml is mature, tested code. It is very stable. If you find bugs, send them in and we'll get them straightened out as soon as possible.
<p>
There are some areas of improvement; please check sourceforge if you are interested in working on TinyXml.
<p>
<h2> Features </h2>

<p>
<h3> Using STL </h3>

<p>
TinyXml can be compiled to use or not use STL. When using STL, TinyXml uses the std::string class, and fully supports std::istream, std::ostream, operator&lt;&lt;, and operator&gt;&gt;. Many API methods have both 'const char*' and 'const std::string&amp;' forms.
<p>
When STL support is compiled out, no STL files are included whatsover. All the string classes are implemented by TinyXml itself. API methods all use the 'const char*' form for input.
<p>
Use the compile time define:
<p>
TIXML_USE_STL
<p>
to compile one version or the other. This can be passed by the compiler, or set as the first line of "tinyxml.h".
<p>
Note: If compiling the test code in Linux, setting the environment variable TINYXML_USE_STL=YES/NO will control STL compilation. In the Windows project file, STL and non STL targets are provided. In your project, its probably easiest to add the line "define TIXML_USE_STL" as the first line of tinyxml.h.
<p>
<h3> Entities </h3>
 TinyXml recognizes the pre-defined "entity references", meaning special characters. Namely:
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
    &amp;amp;   &amp;
    &amp;lt;    &lt;
    &amp;gt;    &gt;
    &amp;quot;  "
    &amp;apos;
</pre></div>
<p>
These are recognized when the XML document is read, and translated to there ASCII equivalents. For instance, text with the XML of:
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
    Far &amp;amp; Away
</pre></div>
<p>
will have the Value() of "Far &amp; Away" when queried from the <a class="el" href="classTiXmlText.html">TiXmlText</a> object, but will be written back to the XML stream/file as an entitity.
<p>
<h3> Streams </h3>
 With TIXML_USE_STL on, TiXml has been modified to support both C (FILE) and C++ (operator&lt;&lt;,&gt;&gt;)  streams. There are some differences that you may need to be aware of.
<p>
C style output:<ul>
<li>based on FILE*<li>the Print() and SaveFile() methods</ul>
Generates formatted output, with plenty of white space, intended to be as  human-readable as possible. They are very fast, and tolerant of ill formed  XML documents. For example, an XML document that contains 2 root elements  and 2 declarations, will print.
<p>
C style input:<ul>
<li>based on FILE*<li>the Parse() and LoadFile() methods</ul>
A fast, tolerant read. Use whenever you don't need the C++ streams.
<p>
C++ style ouput:<ul>
<li>based on std::ostream<li>operator&lt;&lt;</ul>
Generates condensed output, intended for network transmission rather than readability. Depending on your system's implementation of the ostream class, these may be somewhat slower. (Or may not.) Not tolerant of ill formed XML: a document should contain the correct one root element. Additional root level elements will not be streamed out.
<p>
C++ style input:<ul>
<li>based on std::istream<li>operator&gt;&gt;</ul>
Reads XML from a stream, making it useful for network transmission. The tricky part is knowing when the XML document is complete, since there will almost certainly be other data in the stream. TinyXml will assume the XML data is complete after it reads the root element. Put another way, documents that are ill-constructed with more than one root element will not read correctly. Also note that operator&gt;&gt; is somewhat slower than Parse, due to both  implementation of the STL and limitations of TinyXml.
<p>
<h3> White space </h3>
 The world simply does not agree on whether white space should be kept, or condensed. For example, pretend the '_' is a space, and look at "Hello____world". HTML, and  at least some XML parsers, will interpret this as "Hello_world". They condense white space. Some XML parsers do not, and will leave it as "Hello____world". (Remember to keep pretending the _ is a space.) Others suggest that __Hello___world__ should become Hello___world.
<p>
It's an issue that hasn't been resolved to my satisfaction. TinyXml supports the first 2 approaches. Call <a class="el" href="classTiXmlBase.html#d0">TiXmlBase::SetCondenseWhiteSpace</a>( bool ) to set the desired behavior. The default is to condense white space.
<p>
If you change the default, you should call <a class="el" href="classTiXmlBase.html#d0">TiXmlBase::SetCondenseWhiteSpace</a>( bool ) before making any calls to Parse XML data, and I don't recommend changing it after it has been set.
<p>
<h3> Handles </h3>

<p>
Where browsing an XML document in a robust way, it is important to check for null returns from method calls. An error safe implementation can generate a lot of code like:
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
TiXmlElement* root = document.FirstChildElement( "Document" );
if ( root )
{
    TiXmlElement* element = root-&gt;FirstChildElement( "Element" );
    if ( element )
    {
        TiXmlElement* child = element-&gt;FirstChildElement( "Child" );
        if ( child )
        {
            TiXmlElement* child2 = child-&gt;NextSiblingElement( "Child" );
            if ( child2 )
            {
                // Finally do something useful.
</pre></div>
<p>
Handles have been introduced to clean this up. Using the <a class="el" href="classTiXmlHandle.html">TiXmlHandle</a> class, the previous code reduces to:
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
TiXmlHandle docHandle( &amp;document );
TiXmlElement* child2 = docHandle.FirstChild( "Document" ).FirstChild( "Element" ).Child( "Child", 1 ).Element();
if ( child2 )
{
    // do something useful
</pre></div>
<p>
Which is much easier to deal with. See <a class="el" href="classTiXmlHandle.html">TiXmlHandle</a> for more information.
<p>
<h3> Row and Column tracking </h3>
 Being able to track nodes and attributes back to their origin location in source files can be very important for some applications. Additionally, knowing where parsing errors occured in the original source can be very time saving.
<p>
TinyXml can tracks the row and column origin of all nodes and attributes in a text file. The <a class="el" href="classTiXmlBase.html#a3">TiXmlBase::Row</a>() and <a class="el" href="classTiXmlBase.html#a4">TiXmlBase::Column</a>() methods return the origin of the node in the source text. The correct tabs can be  configured in <a class="el" href="classTiXmlDocument.html#a17">TiXmlDocument::SetTabSize</a>().
<p>
<h2> Using and Installing </h2>

<p>
To Compile and Run xmltest:
<p>
A Linux Makefile and a Windows Visual C++ .dsw file is provided.  Simply compile and run. It will write the file demotest.xml to your  disk and generate output on the screen. It also tests walking the DOM by printing out the number of nodes found using different  techniques.
<p>
The Linux makefile is very generic and will probably run on other systems, but is only tested on Linux. You no longer need to run 'make depend'. The dependecies have been hard coded.
<p>
<h3>Windows project file for VC6</h3>
 <ul>
<li>tinyxml: tinyxml library, non-STL  <li>tinyxmlSTL: tinyxml library, STL  <li>tinyXmlTest: test app, non-STL  <li>tinyXmlTestSTL: test app, STL  </ul>
<h3>Linux Make file</h3>
 At the top of the makefile you can set:
<p>
PROFILE, DEBUG, and TINYXML_USE_STL. Details (such that they are) are in the makefile.
<p>
In the tinyxml directory, type "make clean" then "make". The executable file 'xmltest' will be created.
<p>
<h3>To Use in an Application:</h3>

<p>
Add tinyxml.cpp, tinyxml.h, tinyxmlerror.cpp, tinyxmlparser.cpp, and tinystr.cpp to your project or make file. That's it! It should compile on any reasonably compliant C++ system. You do not need to enable exceptions or RTTI for TinyXml.
<p>
<h2> How TinyXml works. </h2>

<p>
An example is probably the best way to go. Take: <div class="fragment"><pre>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone=no&gt;
    &lt;!-- Our to do list data --&gt;
    &lt;ToDo&gt;
        &lt;Item priority="1"&gt; Go to the &lt;bold&gt;Toy store!&lt;/bold&gt;&lt;/Item&gt;
        &lt;Item priority="2"&gt; Do bills&lt;/Item&gt;
    &lt;/ToDo&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
Its not much of a To Do list, but it will do. To read this file  (say "demo.xml") you would create a document, and parse it in: <div class="fragment"><pre>
    TiXmlDocument doc( "demo.xml" );
    doc.LoadFile();
</pre></div>
<p>
And its ready to go. Now lets look at some lines and how they  relate to the DOM.
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone=no&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
The first line is a declaration, and gets turned into the <a class="el" href="classTiXmlDeclaration.html">TiXmlDeclaration</a> class. It will be the first child of the document node.
<p>
This is the only directive/special tag parsed by by TinyXml. Generally directive targs are stored in <a class="el" href="classTiXmlUnknown.html">TiXmlUnknown</a> so the  commands wont be lost when it is saved back to disk.
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
&lt;!-- Our to do list data --&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
A comment. Will become a <a class="el" href="classTiXmlComment.html">TiXmlComment</a> object.
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
&lt;ToDo&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
The "ToDo" tag defines a <a class="el" href="classTiXmlElement.html">TiXmlElement</a> object. This one does not have  any attributes, but does contain 2 other elements.
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
&lt;Item priority="1"&gt; 
</pre></div>
<p>
Creates another <a class="el" href="classTiXmlElement.html">TiXmlElement</a> which is a child of the "ToDo" element.  This element has 1 attribute, with the name "priority" and the value  "1".
<p>
Go to the
<p>
A <a class="el" href="classTiXmlText.html">TiXmlText</a>. This is a leaf node and cannot contain other nodes.  It is a child of the "Item" <a class="el" href="classTiXmlElement.html">TiXmlElement</a>.
<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>
&lt;bold&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
Another <a class="el" href="classTiXmlElement.html">TiXmlElement</a>, this one a child of the "Item" element.
<p>
Etc.
<p>
Looking at the entire object tree, you end up with: <div class="fragment"><pre>
TiXmlDocument               "demo.xml"
    TiXmlDeclaration        "version='1.0'" "standalone=no"
    TiXmlComment            " Our to do list data"
    TiXmlElement            "ToDo"
        TiXmlElement        "Item"      Attribtutes: priority = 1
            TiXmlText       "Go to the "
            TiXmlElement    "bold"
                TiXmlText   "Toy store!"
    TiXmlElement            "Item"      Attributes: priority=2
        TiXmlText           "bills"
</pre></div>
