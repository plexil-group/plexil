=UE Installation=

[[toc]]

==Introduction==

This document is the (wiki) source for the chapter "Installation" in the
Universal Executive Reference Manual, as well as the contents of the
file 'universal-exec/README' in the UE distribution.

The 'universal-exec' directory contains the Universal Executive (UE),
which is an execution system for the PLEXIL language. See the UE and
PLEXIL reference manuals for more information.

This document contains instructions for installing and building the UE,
and pointers on version control and code documentation. Some
familiarity with Unix is assumed.

==Installation==

Your Unix environment should have the following settings to run the UE
and its related tools conveniently. These settings can be made one time
by putting them in your shell's login or initialization file.

Examples are given here for both bash and csh, using the relative
pathname beginning with 'universal-exec' -- you'll need to extend this
to your full pathname (e.g. /home/fred/projects/universal-exec).

Environment variables (csh):

[[code]]
  (all platforms)  setenv UE_HOME universal-exec
  (non-Mac only)   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $UE_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (Mac only)       setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $UE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (Mac only)       setenv DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH 1
[[code]]

Environment variables (bash):

[[code]]
  (all platforms)  export UE_HOME=universal-exec
  (non-Mac only)   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$UE_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (Mac only)       export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$UE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (Mac only)       export DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH=1
[[code]]

The software itself just needs to be built (compiled), and this is
explained in the following section.


==Building the UE==

The 'checkreqs' script in this directory will check for build and
runtime requirements. Type 'checkreqs' to run it.

The [[GettingStarted]] document lists the third party software packages
required for the UE.

If Jam is properly installed and in your path, just typing "jam" in this
directory will build the utility libraries, the executive library, the
module tests, and the executive runner.

==Version Control==

The PLEXIL distribution is maintained in a
[[[http://subversion.tigris.org%7CSubversion|http://subversion.tigris.org|Subversion]] (or SVN)] version control
system. You'll need some knowledge of SVN (which is very similar to
CVS) to interact with the repository after your initial download of
PLEXIL. Interactions include updating to newer files, and (eventually,
for priveleged users) submitting your own changes to PLEXIL.

The 'checksvn' script in this directory will tell you if there are newer
versions of any files in the SVN repository.

==Documentation==

Documentation for the source code can be generated using the tool
[[[http://www.stack.nl/%7Edimitri/doxygen%7CDoxygen%5D.|http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen|Doxygen].]] The file 'ue.dox' is a
Doxygen specification file. If you have installed Doxygen,
documentation for the UE can be generated with the following command.

[[code]]
  doxygen ue.dox
[[code]]

The source code documentation is not as complete or thorough as we would
like, but hopefully it is helpful.
