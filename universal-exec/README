==Introduction==

This document is the (wiki) source for the chapter "Installation" in the
Universal Executive Reference Manual, as well as the contents of the
file 'universal-exec/README' in the UE distribution.

The 'universal-exec' directory contains the Universal Executive (UE),
which is an execution system for the PLEXIL language. See the UE and
PLEXIL reference manuals for more information.

The 'interfaces' directory contains libraries that perform various
common interfacing tasks.  See [[Interfacing|Interfacing with External Systems]] 
for more information on using the interface libraries.

The 'apps/TestExec' directory contains the Test Exec application,
which combines the UE and a simple simulator into a single executable,
as well as plans, simulation scripts, and utilities for running
regression tests.

This document contains instructions for installing and building the UE,
and pointers on version control and code documentation. Some
familiarity with Unix is assumed.

==Installation==

Your Unix environment should have the following settings to run the UE
and its related tools conveniently. These settings can be made one time
by putting them in your shell's login or initialization file.

Examples are given here for both bash and csh, using "/home/fred/plexil"
as the location of your installation -- you'll need to customize this.

Environment variables (csh):

[[code]]
  (all platforms)  setenv PLEXIL_HOME /home/fred/plexil
  (all platforms)  setenv PATH $PLEXIL_HOME/apps/test-exec:$PATH
  (non-Mac only)   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $PLEXIL_HOME/universal-exec/lib:$PLEXIL_HOME/interfaces/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (Mac only)       setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $PLEXIL_HOME/universal-exec/lib:$PLEXIL_HOME/interfaces/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (Mac only)       setenv DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH 1
[[code]]

Environment variables (bash):

[[code]]
  (all platforms)  export PLEXIL_HOME=universal-exec
  (all platforms)  export PATH=$PLEXIL_HOME/Exec/test:$PATH
  (non-Mac only)   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PLEXIL_HOME/universal-exec/lib:$PLEXIL_HOME/interfaces/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (Mac only)       export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PLEXIL_HOME/universal-exec/lib:$PLEXIL_HOME/interfaces/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
  (Mac only)       export DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH=1
[[code]]

The software itself just needs to be built (compiled), and this is
explained in the following section.


==Building the UE==

The 'checkreqs' script in the universal-exec directory will check for build and
runtime requirements. Type 'checkreqs' to run it.

The [[Getting Started]] document lists the third party software packages
required for the UE.

If Jam is properly installed and in your path, the following
instructions will build the UE libraries, the interface libraries, and
the Test Exec application:

[[code]]
 jam
 cd ../interfaces ; jam
 cd ../apps/TestExec ; jam
[[code]]

==Version Control==

The PLEXIL distribution is maintained in a [[http://subversion.tigris.org/|Subversion]]
(or SVN) version control system. You'll need some knowledge of SVN
(which is very similar to CVS) to interact with the repository after
your initial download of PLEXIL. Interactions include updating to newer
files, and (eventually, for privileged users) submitting your own
changes to PLEXIL.

The 'checksvn' script in this directory will tell you if there are newer
versions of any files in the SVN repository.

==Documentation==

Documentation for the source code can be generated using the tool
[[http://www.stack.nl/%7Edimitri/doxygen|Doxygen]]. The file 'ue.dox' is a
Doxygen specification file. If you have installed Doxygen,
documentation for the UE can be generated with the following command.

[[code]]
  doxygen ue.dox
[[code]]

The source code documentation is not as complete or thorough as we would
like, but hopefully it is helpful.
