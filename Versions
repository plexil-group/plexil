This file is a compendium of past release notes for PLEXIL distributions.

4.0.1 (17 June 2015; SVN revision 4357 of the plexil-4 branch)

 - The PLEXIL suite now builds "out of the box" on FreeBSD. Most tools
   work correctly, however IPC is not yet working on FreeBSD.

4.0.0 (15 June 2015; SVN revision 4336 of the plexil-4 branch)

 - Please see the README file for up-to-date build instructions.
 - Executive core has been reimplemented for speed and memory safety.
 - Real-to-Integer conversion functions added.
 - Interfacing API has changed.
 - Standard PLEXIL compiler now has optimization phase, performs 'peephole'
   optimizations where possible.
 - Extended PLEXIL now translates to smaller Core PLEXIL plans in many instances.
 - Shell scripts plexil, plexilexec, plexiltest, plexilsim revised, with improved
   checking for free TCP ports for Viewer.
 - Plexil Viewer significantly improved.
 - Plexil Viewer requires Java 8.
 - Plexil Checker updated and significantly improved.
 - Tests and examples updated, cleaned up.

3.0 (March 14, 2014; SVN revision 3336 of the plexil-3 branch)

 - NOTE:
     - Please see the README file for up-to-date build instructions.
     - Please see the CAVEATS file, as this release has a bunch!
 - Significant improvement of PLEXIL executive's performance (memory usage and speed).
 - Revamped build system, now based GNU's autoconf/automake, to better support
   cross-platform builds.
 - Revamped directory structure of distribution
 - Significant improvements to the Gantt Temporal Viewer
 - Numerous miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements.


2.5 (July 16, 2012; SVN revision 2851)

 - Added ExitCondition to PLEXIL nodes.  This provides a clean way to
   deliberately terminate a plan.  New outcome and failure type
   variables were added to support ExitCondition.  The new user syntax
   and Plexilisp have been updated to match.

 - Additional performance enhancements to the executive.

 - Completely revised node state transition diagrams.  The diagrams now
   accurately reflect the exact behavior of the executive, which is also
   its specified semantics.

 - Assignment node execution and failure are better behaved.  Failure
   of an Assignment node causes the variable's previous value to be
   restored (the old behavior was to assign UNKNOWN). Failing
   Assignment nodes always take priority over any eligible Assignment
   nodes on the same variable.

 - Minor improvements to the InterfaceAdapter API.

 - The PLEXIL_OPTIMIZED build flag is confirmed working.  This flag
   can be used to improve runtime performance for time-critical
   applications.  PLEXIL_DEBUG and PLEXIL_OPTIMIZED can be used
   together for debugging purposes.  See:
   makeinclude/standard-defs.make

 - Cleaned up a number of compiler warnings in the C++ source code.

2.0 (May 4, 2012; SVN revision 2762)

IMPORTANT NOTE: This release has several features that are not
compatible with 1.x based PLEXIL applications.  1.7.1 is the latest
version of PLEXIL available prior to 2.0.  It reflects the state of
PLEXIL's SVN trunk prior to February 6, 2012, and is available on this
SVN branch:

https://plexil.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/plexil/branches/plexil-1.7.1

Please note that the Core Plexil XML representation has not changed. Old
.plx files will continue to work unmodified in Plexil 2.0.

 - Completely revised user syntax: simpler, much more compact.  The old
   syntax is no longer supported, however, at present you can compile
   your Plexil code using Plexil version 1.x and run the output (.plx
   files) in 2.0.

 - Significantly faster Plexil executive, with major speedups in XML
   parsing (see below), construction of internal representations, and
   execution proper.

 - The TinyXML parser has been replaced by pugixml, which proved 20x
   faster in our testing. This was a major contributor to the improved
   performance of the executive.

 - New, simpler interfacing APIs.

 - The Plexil executive's behavior conforms more closely to its
    formal specification.

 - New arithmetic functions: MOD, MAX, MIN
 - Numerous bug fixes and enhancements throughout system.

     documented or officially supported.


1.5  (October 2010)
 - Extensively revised user manual
   * PLEXIL is now presented as a language of high level Actions, of which Core
     PLEXIL (nodes) is the executable subset.  I.e. PLEXIL is now Core PLEXIL
     plus syntactic extensions (formerly called Extended Plexil).  There are no
     changes to Core PLEXIL, and existing Plexil plans are fully compatible.
   * Changes to long-standing PLEXIL nomenclature:
       "Universal Executive" is now "Plexil Executive"
       "Extended PLEXIL" is now just "PLEXIL"
       "LUV" is now "Plexil Viewer"
       "Standalone Simulator" is now "Plexil Simulator"
   * Reorganized; many chapters expanded and corrected
 - New and refactored set of commands for Plexil related applications:
   * plexilexec starts the Plexil Executive, replacing run-ue
   * plexiltest starts the Test Executive, replacing run-te
   * plexilsim runs the Plexil Simulator in one step
   * plexil (formerly the Plexil translator) replaces luv
   * plexilc replaces the former plexil and is an all-purpose translator:
       - translates (standard) Plexil into XML
       - translates Test Executive simulation scripts into XML
       - translates Plexilisp files into XML
 - Enhancements to the Plexil Viewer
   * new Configuration Dialog to select Plexil application and its parameters
   * new Plexil logo
 - Plexil syntax improvements:
   * all-purpose Lookup form obviates need for LookupNow, LookupOnChange
   * OnCommand, OnMessage forms more consistent with other actions
   * uniform usage of colons in action bodies

   * Sequence forms can now contain any attributes, and also structured comments.
   * In command-with-return, reversed order of state name and return variable.
 - Greatly revised examples
   * New small, complete Plexil Executive application in src/apps/sample
   * new multiple-executive plan examples in plexil/examples/multi-exec
   * existing examples revised to use high-level actions where possible

   * Source files: .pst
   * Translated (XML) files: .psx
 - Numerous misc. fixes and enhancements throughout system

1.2.1 (August 2010)
 - IPC-related applications (Robosim, Standalone Simulator, and any
   user-created applications that use IPC) now work in Mac OS

1.1 (April 2010)
 - Added signficant support and language features for inter-executive
   communication, with a new chapter on this feature.  In particular, executives
   can send (and respond to) messages, commands, and state lookups amongst each
   other.
 - Greatly simplified the interfacing of the PLEXIL executive with external
   systems, with a new chapter on this.  In particular:
   * universalExec executable replaces most UE application executables.
   * Interface adapters and exec listeners can be loaded dynamically from shared
     libraries at runtime, and no longer need to be built into the executable.
   * Interface manager now has getProperty() and setProperty() to allow
     communication of arbitrary data between the application, adapters, and
     listeners.
   * Exec listeners and exec listener filters' constructors are now called with
     a 2nd argument, a reference to the interface manager.
 - The LCM (Lightweight Communications and Marshalling) package has been
   completely replaced by CMU's IPC (Inter-Process Communication).  The
   applications that used LCM (standalone simulator, Robosim) now use IPC.
 - The 'run-ue' script now runs 'universalExec' and a new 'run-te' runs the Test
   Executive.  Both can optionally run the PLEXIL static checker first.
 - LUV can run either the TestExecutive (default) or UniversalExec.
 - New Plexilisp Emacs menus (courtesy of Robert Goldman at SIFT). 
 - Numerous miscellaneous fixes, enhancements, and code refactorings across the
   entire system.
 - Much revision of the reference manual.

1.0
 - Revamped source code directory structure.
 - Replaced 'jam' with 'make' as the system's build tool.
 - Added a new application IpcExec, allowing multiple communicating executives.
 - Added CMU's "IPC" system to support IpcExec, and future planned applications.
 - Numerous small fixes and enhancements throughout the system.
 CAVEATS: 
 - Standalone Simulator may not work in Mac OS and some
   versions of Linux, due to errors in the LCM library.  LCM
   is in the process of being replaced by IPC.
 - A PDF version of the user manual, normally included in the distribution, 
   is not available; we are seeking a means to create one from the new wiki
   system used by Sourceforge.


0.91
 - Deprecated Function Call node.
 - Added 'jam' executables in plexil/bin
 - Added support for testing node iteration outcome.
 - Extended Plexil: added Concurrence form; bug fixes
 - Plexilisp: added Wait, Concurrence; action forms can now contain
   nodes or node bodies; empty sequences are properly supported
 - XML schema updates
 CAVEATS: 
 - Standalone Simulator may not work in Mac OS and some versions of
   Linux, due to errors in the LCM library.  The problem is being worked on.


0.90
 - New application framework, revised external interfaces, and simple
   test application using both.  See the app-framework directory.  The
   existing external interfaces are unchanged from the previous release,
   but are deprecated.
 - Standard Plexil no longer supports hyphenated variable names. Hyphenated
   variables may be supported in a future release.
 - Standalone simulator now supports telemetry and has a test executive.
 - New Extended Plexil language: schema, translator, examples.
 - Plexilisp has several new constructs and generates Extended Plexil
 - Refactoring of Plexil schemas.
 - New enhancements and bug fixes to the Luv Viewer.
 - Top level Makefile and simplified build and installation instructions.
 - Numerous small enhancements and bug fixes throughout code base.


0.84
 - new component: a standalone simulator for PLEXIL.
 - new component: static checker for PLEXIL.
 - added global declarations (for static plan checking) to schemas and
   Plexilisp
 - additional workshop slides
 - easier setup for Plexilisp
 - misc bug fixes and enhancements


0.83
 - critical bug fix for event processing
 - the Node Priority clause has been deprecated.  It had semantic
   issues, and is not used in any known PLEXIL applications.  Multiple
   assignments to the same variable occuring simultaneously results in a
   runtime error.  At this stage, the Priority clause has only been
   removed from documentation and tests.  It is still implemented, as an
   undocumented and unsupported feature.  It may someday be removed from
   the implementation without notice.  A better solution may be designed.
 - more documentation regarding concurrency in list nodes
 - added PLEXIL workshop presentations
 - significant revision of several UE reference manual chapters
 - PDF manuals now included in distribution

   creating new 'bin' and 'apps' directories
 - slightly simplified installation
 - added RoboSim example application and plans
 - reduced response time to external world events
 - support for 64-bit architectures
 - numerous minor fixes and enhancements


0.81
 - new syntax and translator for simulation scripts
   (standard-plexil/plexilscript)
 - numerous minor fixes and enhancements

0.80
 - first Sourceforge release
