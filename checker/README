This directory contains a program for checking global declarations
against their usage within a PLEXIL plan.

The current system allows users to include global declarations within a
PLEXIL program, but it does not verify that the nodes' implementation
follows the declarations. This program is designed to be an addon that
checks for proper implementation.

Global declarations include the following:
  - Commands
  - Functions
  - Lookups
  - Library Nodes (implemented in the schema?)

The file plans/test.plx shows some examples of global declaration
syntax, though the program itself is not designed to be executed.

It also uses Java generic lists, introduced in JDK 1.5. So, make sure
your latest Java version is 1.5 or newer.
