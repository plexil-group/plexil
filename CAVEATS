This file, plexil/CAVEATS, lists known bugs and issues in the
PLEXIL system.

IPC and related applications (inter-executive
communication, Standalone Simulator, Robosim) are not working
in MacOS PowerPC (Intel-based Macs seem fine).  Plans hang
when the executive is started, and the underlying problem is
that messaging threads are getting destroyed.

Robosim: The (graphical) robot simulator does not always
shut down cleanly.

Standard Plexil compiler ('plexil'): File extensions included
in the '-o' option are ignored: Extended and Core Plexil files
are always written with the ".epx" and ".plx" extensions,
respectively.
