This file, plexil/CAVEATS, lists known bugs and issues in this version
of PLEXIL.

Build: 
 * If the GNU autotools installed on your system are a different
   version from the ones used to build this release, you may encounter
   errors running 'make'. The following commands can replace the bad
   files with compatible ones from your local installation:
     cd $PLEXIL_HOME/src
     aclocal --force
     libtoolize --force --copy
     autoreconf --force --install
   You should be able to re-run 'make' successfully at this point.

 * The following subsystems are built by default: 
     - the Test Executive
     - the UDP adapter
     - Gantt viewer support
     - IPC and modules which depend on it: Plexil Simulator, Robosim,
     IPC adapter, et al

   The following are not built by default:
     - module tests

   See the "Advanced builds" section in the README file for
   instructions on how to use the 'configure' script to select the
   particular subsystems and applications you need.

 * The Plexil example plans and applications (found in
   plexil-4/examples) are NOT compiled by default. Plans (.ple files)
   must be compiled manually (with plexilc) to produce .plx files. The
   application directories (examples/sample-app and examples/robosim)
   must be built by typing 'make'.

Custom builds:

 * The default installation location for PLEXIL libraries and
   executables under the GNU autotools is /usr/local. The installation
   locations can be specified with the '--prefix=', '--bindir=',
   '--libdir=', and '--includedir' option to 'configure'. We recommend
   installing these files in the PLEXIL installation directory
   itself. E.g.:
     cd $PLEXIL_HOME/src ./configure --prefix=$PLEXIL_HOME [... more options ...]

 * By default, the GNU autotools build both dynamic and static
   libraries.  Static linking currently does not work on some
   systems. To save build time and disk space, we recommend that you
   build only the dynamic (shared) libraries on modern Linux and Mac
   platforms. This is done by supplying the '--disable-static' option
   to 'configure'.


Plexil Viewer: 

 * Multiple actions with the same name (Node ID) will not show correct
   status and outcome.  The viewer does not seem to distinguish the
   actions.

 * The viewer may fail to display the plan if it uses more than one
   library node.

 * When started from a script via the '-v' option, the viewer does not
   distinguish between "normal" and Core Plexil plan view, always
   showing the latter.


Plexil compiler ('plexilc'): 

 * File extensions included in the '-o' option are ignored:
   Extended and Core Plexil files are always written with the
   ".epx" and ".plx" extensions, respectively.

 * Node timepoints cannot be assigned to variables.
