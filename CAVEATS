This file, plexil/CAVEATS, lists known bugs and issues in the PLEXIL system.


Moderate problems
-----------------

Plexil Viewer: 

 * Multiple actions with the same name (Node ID) will not show correct status
   and outcome.  The viewer does not seem to distinguish the actions.

 * The viewer may fail to display the plan if it uses more than one library
   node.


Minor problems
--------------

Robosim: The (graphical) robot simulator does not always
shut down cleanly.

Plexil to XML translator ('plexilc'): 

 * File extensions included in the '-o' option are ignored:
   Extended and Core Plexil files are always written with the
   ".epx" and ".plx" extensions, respectively.

 * Node timepoints cannot be assigned to variables.

Sometimes, the Plexil executive outputs the following error when a plan
finishes.  It has no effect on plan execution but does crash the executive:

  Assertion failed: (false), function handleAssert, file Error.cc, line 89.
  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'SocketException'
