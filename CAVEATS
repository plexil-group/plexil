This file, plexil/CAVEATS, lists known bugs and issues in the PLEXIL system.

Minor problems
--------------

In the Plexil Viewer, the Configuration Dialog is a new feature and still has
some bugs.  In particular, incorrect selections might appear when the Script and
Config buttons are clicked.  These can be overwritten by choosing the desired
file in the file browser that opens.

Robosim: The (graphical) robot simulator does not always
shut down cleanly.

Standard Plexil compiler ('plexil'): 

 * File extensions included in the '-o' option are ignored:
   Extended and Core Plexil files are always written with the
   ".epx" and ".plx" extensions, respectively.

 * Node timepoints cannot be assigned to variables.
