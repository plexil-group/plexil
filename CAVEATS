This file, plexil/CAVEATS, lists known bugs and issues in this version
of PLEXIL.

Build: 

 * If the GNU autotools installed on your system are a different
   version from the ones used to build this release, you may encounter
   errors running 'make'. The following commands can replace the bad
   files with compatible ones from your local installation:

  cd $PLEXIL_HOME/src
  aclocal --force
  libtoolize --force --copy
  autoreconf --force --install

   You should be able to re-run 'configure' and 'make' successfully at
   this point.

 * The following subsystems in the src directory are built by default: 
     - the Universal Executive
     - the Test Executive
     - IPC and IPC Adapter
     - UDP Adapter
     - GANTT listener
     - Plexil Simulator

   The following are not built by default:
     - module tests

   See the "Advanced builds" section in the README file for
   instructions on how to use the 'configure' script to select the
   particular subsystems and applications you need.

 * The Plexil example plans and applications (found in
   plexil-4/examples) are NOT compiled by default. Plans (.ple files)
   must be compiled manually (with plexilc) to produce .plx files. The
   application directories (examples/sample-app and examples/robosim)
   must be built by typing 'make'.

Custom builds:

 * The default installation location for PLEXIL libraries and
   executables under the GNU autotools is /usr/local. The installation
   locations can be specified with the '--prefix=', '--bindir=',
   '--libdir=', and '--includedir=' options to 'configure'. We
   suggest installing these files in the PLEXIL installation
   directory itself. E.g.:

 cd $PLEXIL_HOME/src
 ./configure --prefix=$PLEXIL_HOME [... more options ...]

 * By default, the GNU autotools build both dynamic and static
   libraries. This consumes time and disk space. Unless your
   application specifically requires static libraries, we recommend
   that you build only the dynamic (shared) libraries. This is done by
   supplying the '--disable-static' option to 'configure'.

PLEXIL executive and interfaces:

 * The IPC subsystem is not yet working on FreeBSD (as of PLEXIL
   4.0.1). Unfortunately, this means many of the example applications
   cannot be used on FreeBSD.

Standard Plexil language:

 * Node timepoints cannot be assigned to variables.

Plexil Viewer: 

 * The Plexil Viewer has been completely reimplemented for release
   4.5. Many old bugs have been squashed, but it is likely many new
   ones have been introduced. We encourage users to report any
   problems to plexil-support@sourceforge.net.

Plexil compiler ('plexilc'): 

 * File extensions included in the '-o' option are ignored:
   Extended and Core Plexil files are always written with the
   ".epx" and ".plx" extensions, respectively.
