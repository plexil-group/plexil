This file lists known bugs and issues in this version of PLEXIL.

Build: 

 * The build process of this plexil-3 branch is *very* different from that of
   the SVN trunk version of PLEXIL (and all pre-3 versions of PLEXIL.  It is
   more difficult, and has its own caveats.  See the file BUILD.  We hope to
   radicaly simplify the build process soon.

Plexil Viewer: 

 * Multiple actions with the same name (Node ID) will not show correct
   status and outcome.  The viewer does not seem to distinguish the
   actions.

 * The viewer may fail to display the plan if it uses more than one
   library node.

 * When started from a script via the '-v' option, the viewer does not
   distinguish between "normal" and Core Plexil plan view, always
   showing the latter.


Plexil compiler ('plexilc'): 

 * File extensions included in the '-o' option are ignored:
   Extended and Core Plexil files are always written with the
   ".epx" and ".plx" extensions, respectively.

 * Node timepoints cannot be assigned to variables.

PLEXIL Simulator:

 * Command and Lookup arguments are ignored.

 * How to parse a command's returns values, and receive them in the calling
   plan, is unspecified.

 * The delay argument to commands is ignored.

 * It is unspecified whether *both* specific and general cases of command
   invocations can be simulated -- each works in itself.

 
Robosim:

 * The Robosim 2D graphical application, used as a testbed for PLEXIL plans, is
   not supported in this release, but is being worked on and will hopefully be
   available soon.

 * The graphical robot simulator (when it is supported again) does not always
   shut down cleanly.
