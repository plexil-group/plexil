This file lists known bugs and issues in this version of PLEXIL.

Build: 

 * The build process of this plexil-3 branch is *very* different from that of
   the SVN trunk version of PLEXIL (and all pre-3 versions of PLEXIL.  It is
   more difficult, and has its own caveats.  See the file BUILD.  We hope to
   radicaly simplify the build process soon.

 * The Plexil example plans and applications (found in plexil-3/examples) are
   NOT compiled by default. Plans (.ple files) must be compiled manually (with
   plexilc) to produce .plx files.

 * For the manually-built PLEXIL subystems and applications mentioned
   above, the dynamic libraries produced (e.g. .dylib files in Mac OS,
   .so files in Linux) might not be automatically copied to, or linked
   to from, the directory in which they are expected to be found,
   which is $PLEXIL_HOME/lib. You may have to make these copies or
   symbolic links manually. 


Plexil Viewer: 

 * Multiple actions with the same name (Node ID) will not show correct
   status and outcome.  The viewer does not seem to distinguish the
   actions.

 * The viewer may fail to display the plan if it uses more than one
   library node.

 * When started from a script via the '-v' option, the viewer does not
   distinguish between "normal" and Core Plexil plan view, always
   showing the latter.


Plexil compiler ('plexilc'): 

 * File extensions included in the '-o' option are ignored:
   Extended and Core Plexil files are always written with the
   ".epx" and ".plx" extensions, respectively.

 * Node timepoints cannot be assigned to variables.

PLEXIL Simulator:

 * Command and Lookup arguments are ignored.

 * How to parse a command's returns values, and receive them in the calling
   plan, is unspecified.

 * The delay argument to commands is ignored.

 * It is unspecified whether *both* specific and general cases of command
   invocations can be simulated -- each works in itself.

 
Robosim:

 * The Robosim 2D graphical application, used as a testbed for PLEXIL plans, is
   not supported in this release, but is being worked on and will hopefully be
   available soon.

 * The graphical robot simulator (when it is supported again) does not always
   shut down cleanly.
