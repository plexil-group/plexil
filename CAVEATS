This file, plexil/CAVEATS, lists known bugs and issues in the PLEXIL system.

Plexil Viewer: 

 * Multiple actions with the same name (Node ID) will not show correct status
   and outcome.  The viewer does not seem to distinguish the actions.

 * The viewer may fail to display the plan if it uses more than one library
   node.

 * When started from a script via the '-v' option, the viewer does not
   distinguish between "normal" and Core Plexil plan view, always showing the
   latter.


Plexil compiler ('plexilc'): 

 * File extensions included in the '-o' option are ignored:
   Extended and Core Plexil files are always written with the
   ".epx" and ".plx" extensions, respectively.

 * Node timepoints cannot be assigned to variables.


Robosim application: 

* The (graphical) robot simulator does not always shut down cleanly.
