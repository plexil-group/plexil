This file, plexil/CAVEATS, lists known bugs and issues in the
PLEXIL system.

Major problems
--------------

IPC and related applications (inter-executive communication,
Standalone Simulator, Robosim) are not working under MacOS.
Plans hang when the executive is started, and the underlying
problem is that messaging threads are getting destroyed.


Minor problems
--------------

Robosim: The (graphical) robot simulator does not always
shut down cleanly.

Standard Plexil compiler ('plexil'): 

 * File extensions included inn the '-o' option are ignored:
   Extended and Core Plexil files are always written with the
   ".epx" and ".plx" extensions, respectively.

 * Node timepoints cannot be assigned to variables.
