This file, plexil/CAVEATS, lists known bugs and issues in the
PLEXIL system.

IPC and related applications (inter-executive communication,
Standalone Simulator, Robosim)
------------------------------------------------------------

There are several intermittent bugs associated with use of IPC (communications
package).  They occur when an executive is started, or sometimes when the plan
ends.  They sometimes occur in tandem.  The workaround is to simply try again!
Linux behaves much better than MacOS.

1. This one is most common, occurring at startup.

  Initializing application
  NMP IPC Version 3.8.5 (Nov-09-09)
  ... IPC Connected on port 1381
  Starting interfaces


2. This one usually occurs at exit, and does not appear to affect plan
   execution.

  ERROR: RecursiveThreadMutex.cc:61: Attempted to destroy mutex while locked or referenced.
  Assertion failed: (false), function handleAssert, file Error.cc, line 94.

3. This one occurs mainly in MacOS, but occasionally in Linux too:

  Initializing application
  NMP IPC Version 3.8.5 (Nov-09-09)
  ... IPC Connected on port 1381
  Starting interfaces
  ERROR: received message with data that is not packed.
  universalExec(11167,0xba9820) malloc: *** mmap(size=1509953536) failed (error code=12)
  *** error: can't allocate region
  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
  x_ipcMalloc: NULL returned from malloc for request: 1509949504

  ERROR: Reading Data Message in x_ipc_waitForReplyFrom 4.


Robosim
-------

The (graphical) robot simulator does not always shut down cleanly.


Standard Plexil compiler ('plexil')
-----------------------------------

File extensions included in the '-o' option are ignored: Extended and Core
Plexil files are always written with the ".epx" and ".plx" extensions,
respectively.
