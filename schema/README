This directory contains the PLEXIL schema and related files:

plexil.xsd (and its equivalent plexil.rnc) are schemas for the latest
design of PLEXIL.  They are referred to as the "blessed" schema.

supported-plexil.xsd (and its equivalent supported-plexil.rnc) define
the PLEXIL that is currently implemented by the Universal Executive.

plexil-script.xsd (and its equivalent plexil-script.rnc) are schemas for
the simulation script.

Makefile and 'rncfix' are used to generate .rnc schemas from .xsd.  This
process is described within Makefile.
