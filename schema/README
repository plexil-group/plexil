This directory contains the PLEXIL schemas and related files.  Look
inside the files for more comments.

All schemas are provided in two formats: XSD and RNC (Compact Relax
NG).  We use two third-party tools, Saxon and trang, and an XSLT
stylesheet to create the RNC schemas.

The Makefile is used to generate .rnc schemas from .xsd.  This process
is described within Makefile.  'make' regenerates the .rnc files.
This is a tool intended for use by the PLEXIL development team; no
user should expect to need to run it.

Schemas provided here:

- core-plexil.xsd defines the Core PLEXIL language as currently
executed by the Plexil Executive.

- extended-plexil.xsd defines the Extended PLEXIL language, a superset
of Core PLEXIL with additional convenience macros.

- safe-plexil.xsd defines a restricted subset of Core PLEXIL that is
easier to verify using static analysis tools.

- plexil-base.xsd is the common subset of the above three schemas.

- plexil-script.xsd is the schema for the Test Executive simulation script.

- core-plexil-v2.xsd, extended-plexil-v2.xsd, and plexil-base-v2.xsd
describe a more compact version of the PLEXIL language. The Plexil
Executive will be modified at some future date to parse this Core
PLEXIL variant.

Translators provided here:

Translators are implemented using XSLT stylesheets. 

- translate-plexil.xsl translates Extended Plexil into Core Plexil.
It can be run conveniently with the 'eplexil' script found in
plexil/scripts (see that directory for more information), though in
normal usage it is run automatically when Standard Plexil or Plexilisp
files are processed.

- canonicalize-v1.xsl reformats a Core PLEXIL plan into a standardized
format, which facilitates comparisons during translator and compiler
debugging.

- summarize-plexil.xsl generates a concise textual summary of a Core
PLEXIL file.  To use it, run the script file found at
scripts/summarize-plexil .

- plexil-v1-to-v2.xsl translates the current Core PLEXIL language into
the version 2 form.

- plexil-v2-to-v1.xsl translates Core PLEXIL version 2 language into
the version 1 form.

- XSDtoRNG.xsl translates the .xsd schema files into RELAX NG
format. This is an intermediate step in the XSD to RNC translation.
