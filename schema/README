This directory contains the PLEXIL schemas and related files.  Look
inside the files for more comments.

All schemas are provided in two formats: XSD and RNG (Compact
Relax NG).  We use two third-party tools to create the RNG
schemas, which are provided with PLEXIL in the 'plexil/third-party' directory.

Schemas:

* extended-plexil.xsd defines the full PLEXIL language, as currently
  supported.

* core-plexil.xsd defines the Core PLEXIL language as currently
  implemented by the Plexil Executive.

* core-plexil-draft.xsd is a schema for (what were once) planned
  extensions to Core PLEXIL.

* safe-plexil.xsd defines a restricted version of Core PLEXIL that is
  easier to verify.

* plexil-script.xsd is the schema for the Test Executive simulation script.

* schema-for-xslt30.rnc is a schema for XSLT stylesheets.  It provides
  editing support for XSLT.

* schemas.xml is used by GNU Emacs's nxml-mode, to locate schemas
  for the various XML document types found here.

Makefile and 'rncfix' are used to generate .rnc schemas from .xsd.  This
process is described within Makefile.

For more information, see the following chapter of the PLEXIL manual:

The epx-translator directory contains an XSLT stylesheet that
translates Extended Plexil into Core Plexil.  It can be run
conveniently with the 'eplexil' script found in plexil/bin (see that
directory for more information), though in normal usage is run
automatically when Plexil or Plexilisp files are processed.

The test directory contains a regression test suite for the Extended
Plexil translator.

The validator directory contains schema validation tools for PLEXIL,
used by the test directory and by the Standard PLEXIL compiler
regression test suite.
