This directory contains the PLEXIL schemas and related files.  Look
inside the files for more comments.

plexil.xsd (and its equivalent plexil.rnc) are schemas for the latest
design of Core PLEXIL.  They are referred to as the "blessed" schema.

core-plexil.xsd (and its equivalent core-plexil.rnc) define the Core
PLEXIL that is currently implemented by the Universal Executive.

safe-plexil.xsd (and its equivalent safe-plexil.rnc) define a restricted
version of Core PLEXIL that is easier to verify.

extended-plexil.xsd (and its equivalent extended-plexil.rnc) define an
extension of Core PLEXIL that adds conditionals, loops, and other
convenient forms.

plexil-script.xsd (and its equivalent plexil-script.rnc) are schemas for
the simulation script.

translate-plexil.xsl is an XSLT program that translates Extended Plexil
into Core Plexil.  It is run conveniently via the 'eplexil' script found
in plexil/bin.  See that directory for more information.

Makefile and 'rncfix' are used to generate .rnc schemas from .xsd.  This
process is described within Makefile.

  supported-plexil.xsd (and its equivalent supported-plexil.rnc) define
  the PLEXIL that is currently implemented by the Universal Executive.
