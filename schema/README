This directory contains the PLEXIL schemas and related files.  Look
inside the files for more comments.

All schemas are provided in two formats: XSD and RNG (Compact
Relax NG).  We use two third-party tools to create the RNG
schemas, which are provided with PLEXIL in the 'plexil/third-party' directory.

extended-plexil.xsd define the full PLEXIL language, as currently supported.
(This name is vestigial, and will be changed to 'plexil.xsd' in a future
release).

core-plexil.xsd defines the Core PLEXIL language as currently implemented by the
Plexil Executive.

core-plexil-draft.xsd is a schema for planned extensions to Core PLEXIL.

safe-plexil.xsd defines a restricted version of Core PLEXIL that is
easier to verify.

plexil-script.xsd is the schema for the Test Executive simulation script.

translate-plexil.xsl is an XSLT program that translates full Plexil into Core
Plexil.  It can be run conveniently with the 'eplexil' script found in
plexil/bin (see that directory for more information), though in normal usage is
run automatically when Plexil or Plexilisp files are processed.

Makefile and 'rncfix' are used to generate .rnc schemas from .xsd.  This
process is described within Makefile.
