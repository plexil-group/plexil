This directory contains the PLEXIL schemas and related files.  Look
inside the files for more comments.

All schemas are provided in two formats: XSD and RNG (Compact
Relax NG).  We use two third-party tools to create the RNG
schemas; these are not provided with PLEXIL; see Makefile for
the names and sources of these tools.

core-plexil.xsd define the Core PLEXIL that is currently implemented by
the Universal Executive.

core-plexil-draft.xsd is a schema for planned extensions to Core PLEXIL
(core-plexil).

safe-plexil.xsd defines a restricted version of Core PLEXIL that is
easier to verify.

extended-plexil.xsd define an extension of Core PLEXIL that adds
conditionals, loops, and other convenient forms.

plexil-script.xsd are schemas for the simulation script.

translate-plexil.xsl is an XSLT program that translates Extended Plexil
into Core Plexil.  It is run conveniently via the 'eplexil' script found
in plexil/bin.  See that directory for more information.

Makefile and 'rncfix' are used to generate .rnc schemas from .xsd.  This
process is described within Makefile.
