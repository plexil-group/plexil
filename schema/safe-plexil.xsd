  This schema defines a version of PLEXIL that restricts Core PLEXIL
  (defined in core-plexil.xsd) making it "safer" with respect to
  verifiability.  The only such restriction is requiring the names of 
  commands, function calls, and lookups to be strings, rather than
  arbitrary string expressions (including state lookups).  This restriction
  was part of the original Core Plexil.
