-----

Usage: validate [OPTIONS] [INFILES]...

  Validate XML files against a schema.

Options:

  -v, --verbose  Generate extra output
  --schema PATH  Schema file to validate against
  --cache        Use cache if schema is a local file
  --help         Show this message and exit.

Return status is 0 if all files were valid, 1 if one or more failed
