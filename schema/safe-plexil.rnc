# This schema defines a version of PLEXIL that restricts Core PLEXIL
# (defined in core-plexil.xsd) making it "safer" with respect to
# verifiability.  The only such restriction is requiring the names of 
# commands, function calls, and lookups to be strings, rather than
# arbitrary string expressions (including state lookups).  This restriction
# was part of the original Core Plexil.
