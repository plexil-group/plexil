<p>
    This tutorial will show you how to use all of the core functionality
    of LCM, including message transmission, subscription, and message
    encoding. This guide is intended for those who have a working
    knowledge of Java, and it should simultaneously provide a brief
    introduction to using LCM. For detailed information about LCM,
    however, please see the LCM documentation.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id407375"></a><h2>Core LCM concepts</h2>
<p>
    LCM is a package designed to allow multiple processes to exchange
    messages in a safe and high-performance way. LCM was designed for
    online real-time applications communicating via private
    ethernets. 
  </p>
<p>
    A <span class="emphasis"><em>message</em></span> is the basic unit of LCM
    communications: it represents a self-contained unit. Messages are
    defined using a language-independent definition language; the
    lcm-gen tool compiles these definitions into language-specific
    encoding and decoding functions. Java applications can thus
    communicate with applications written in other languages: issues
    like byte order are taken care of by LCM.
  </p>
<p>
    For a simple example, suppose that we are building a system that
    will record the temperature in a number of different
    locations. One reasonable implementation would be to have a
    message contain a single temperature measurement. The LCM type
    specification, saved to a file named temperature_t.lcm, might look
    like this:
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
struct temperature_t
{
  int64_t  utime;
  double   deg_celsius;
}  </pre>
<p>
    We can compile this specification into a class file by invoking
    lcm-gen with the -j flag.
  </p>
<p>
    There is no single correct way to define a message, but this
    example illustrates several useful conventions. First, the name of
    the type is "temperature_t": by convention, all LCM types end in a
    "_t" suffix. Type names are typically all lower-case with
    underscores between word boundaries (e.g., "wind_speed_t"). The
    type also contains a timestamp, conventionally denoted as a 64 bit
    integer giving the number of microseconds since a noteworthy epoch
    (often the UNIX epoch). Finally, embedding the units into the
    names of the variables (e.g., "deg_celsius") helps prevent errors.
  </p>
<p>Each message is sent on a <span class="emphasis"><em>channel</em></span>, which
    is identified by a human-readable name. For example, messages
    containing information about the temperature in the hallway might
    be published on the "HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE" channel. By convention,
    all messages on a channel have the same type.
  </p>
<p>
    Any application can publish on any channel, however, in many
    cases, a single application serves as the sole source of data on a
    channel. Any application can receive data on any channel--- for
    example, both a thermostat application and data logger might
    subscribe to the "HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE" channel.
  </p>
<p>
    The remainder of the tutorial is divided into the four steps
    required to make a working LCM application:
  </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>Initializing LCM</li>
<li>Defining LCM types</li>
<li>Publishing messages</li>
<li>Subscribing to messages</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
    Defining LCM types is fairly intuitive and is language neutral. We
    thus direct you to the LCM type specification reference. The
    remainder of the tutorial on the other topics.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id406971"></a><h2>Initializing LCM</h2>
<p>
    You will need to make sure that <span class="emphasis"><em>lcm.jar</em></span> is in
    your classpath, and your Java classes will need to include "import
    lcm.lcm.*". To initialize LCM, with default options, simply call:
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
LCM myLCM = LCM.getSingleton();  </pre>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id406990"></a><h2>Publishing a message</h2>
<p>
    In order to use LCM types, you must include the class files for
    your LCM delcared types in a jar file on your classpath.
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
temperature_t temp = new temperature_t();
temp.utime = System.nanoTime()/1000;
temp.deg_celsius = 25.0;

myLCM.publish("HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE", temp);  </pre>
<p>
    Keep in mind that LCM is typically a lossy communications
    mechanism. In a typical configuration on a private ethernet,
    messages are only lost when a sender is transmitting faster than a
    receiver can receive. Still, an application should not be designed
    around reliable or ordered delivery. If reliable delivery is
    required, it must be built on top of LCM (using a handshake or
    acknowledgement mechanism, for example).
  </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id407015"></a><h2>Subscribing to messages</h2>
<p>
    In order to receive messages, you must register an LCMSubscriber
    and pass it to the LCM object using the subscribe call. The
    subscriber will be provided with a DataInputStream that can be
    read for the message contents. All LCM data types include a
    constructor that takes a DataInputStream as an argument. First,
    let's look at the subscriber:
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
public class MySubscriber implements LCMSubscriber
{
   public void messageReceived(LCM lcm, String channel, DataInputStream ins)
   {
      if (channel.equals("HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE")) 
      {
         try {
            temperature_t temp = new temperature_t(ins);
            System.out.println("The temperature is: "+temp.deg_celsius);
         } catch (IOException ex) {
            System.out.println("Error decoding temperature message: "+ex);
         }
      }
   }
}  </pre>
<p>
    Now, we can subscribe to the message with just:
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
myLCM.subscriber("HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE", new MySubscriber());  </pre>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id407043"></a><h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>
    We now provide complete code for two programs: the first will
    periodically transmit a simulated temperature and the second will
    subscribe to and display that temperature. We assume that the
    temperature_t.class file (resulting from invoking lcm-gen -j
    temperature_t.lcm) can be found on the classpath.
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
import lcm.lcm.*;
    
public class TemperatureTransmit
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
	LCM myLCM = LCM.getSingleton();

	while (true)
	    {
                temperature_t temp = new temperature_t();
                temp.utime = System.nanoTime()/1000;
                temp.deg_celsius = 25.0 + 5*Math.sin(System.nanoTime()/1000000000.0);

                myLCM.publish("HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE", temp);

		try {
		    Thread.sleep(10);
		} catch (InterruptedException ex) {
		}
	    }
    }
}  </pre>
<pre class="programlisting">
import lcm.lcm.*;
import java.io.*;

public class TemperatureDisplay implements LCMSubscriber
{
    public void messageReceived(LCM lcm, String channel, DataInputStream ins)
    {
	try {
	    temperature_t temp = new temperature_t(ins);
	    System.out.println("The temperature is: "+temp.deg_celsius);
	} catch (IOException ex) {
	    System.out.println("Error decoding temperature message: "+ex);
	}
    }

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
	LCM myLCM = LCM.getSingleton();

	myLCM.subscribe("HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE", new TemperatureDisplay());

	// Sleep forever: if we quit, so will the LCM thread.
	while (true) 
	    {
		try {
		    Thread.sleep(1000);
		} catch (InterruptedException ex) {
		}
	    }
    }
}  </pre>
<p>
    To compile and run these, let us assume that the lcm.jar file is
    in the current directory (along with TemperatureDisplay.java,
    TemperatureTransmit.java, and temperature_t.lcm). We can run our
    programs by executing the commands:
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
# 1. Create the Java implementation of temperature_t.lcm
lcm-gen -j temperature_t.lcm

# 2. Compile the demo applications and the LCM type created above.
javac -cp .:lcm.jar *.java

# 3. Run TemperatureTransmit (in one terminal)
java -cp .:lcm.jar TemperatureTransmit 

# 4. Run Temperature Display (in another terminal)
java -cp .:lcm.jar TemperatureDisplay  </pre>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id407087"></a><h2>Namespace issues</h2>
<p>
  LCM supports namespaces for data types, making it easier for users to
  use the types defined by others without worry that those types will
  conflict with other users' types. 
</p>
<p>
  When defining a type, the name of the type can include a namespace,
  e.g., "struct examples.temperature_t { ... }". When compiled with
  lcm-gen, this will result in a class named "temperature_t" in
  package "examples". If lcm-gen is given the root of a source tree
  with the --jpath flag, it will automatically put temperature_t.class
  in the examples subdirectory. You will need to remember to import
  that type before you use it, e.g., "import examples.*", or else you
  will need to refer to types by their fully-qualified names
  (e.g., "new examples.temperature_t()").
</p>
<p>
  Note that if you do not specify a package name in your LCM type
  definition file, lcm-gen will (by default) put those types into the
  "lcmtypes" Java package. This is necessary because Java does not
  official support packageless classes.
