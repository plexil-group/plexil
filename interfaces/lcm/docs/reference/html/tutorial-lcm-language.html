<p>
    In addition to providing a set of communications primitives, LCM
    includes utilities for generating platform-independent marshalling
    and unmarshalling functions for user-defined data types. It is
    similar to XDR, though it is written with greater type safety in
    mind, and with the goal of first-class support for a variety of
    languages including C, Java, and Python. This document describes
    the data marshalling facility; the communications facility is
    described elsewhere. Note that it is possible to use the data
    marshalling features of LCM independently of LCM's communication
    facilities.
  </p>
<div class="refsect2" lang="en">
<a name="id413314"></a><h3>Design Goals</h3>
<p>
    The primary design goals of the LCM marshalling facility are:

    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>Provide a simple mechanism to define complex types
	that would be immediately comfortable to users of C and
	Java</li>
<li>Provide first class support for a wide variety of
	client languages</li>
<li>Abstract away platform-specific details such as byte
	ordering</li>
<li>Maximize the amount of compile-time and run-time type
	safety</li>
<li>Be able to detect message type incompatibilities, such
	as when two applications have different versions of the same
	datatype</li>
<li>Produce space-efficient encoded messages</li>
<li>Minimize encoding and decoding computational
	costs</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
    The current version of LCM achieves these goals with only a few
    compromises. In some cases, a least-common-denominator approach
    was used to ensure that all platforms supported the features
    provided by LCM.
  </p>

<a name="id413362"></a><h3>Development History</h3>
<p>
      LCM's marshalling facilities were created for use on MIT's DARPA
      Urban Challenge vehicle, with development starting during the
      summer of 2006. Early versions supported many features that have
      since been deprecated: reducing the number of extraneous
      features has simplified the code base significantly, since most
      features typically impact several language back-ends (currently
      C, Java, and Python).
    </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id413378"></a><h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>
    LCM is most similar to XDR, which is used in RPC and is described
    by RFC4506. Both use a C-like syntax (and even C keywords like
    "struct"). LCM differs in that its language is smaller:
    rarely-used features like unions are not supported. LCM does not
    support pointers: this eliminates the pointer-chasing problems
    that can arise in XDR. Variable-length arrays are supported in a
    more natural way in LCM, and LCM includes a type "signature" in
    the encoded data. This type signature allows run-time error
    detection.

<p>
    MOOS
  </p>
<p>
    It seems that every data encoding representation is invariably
    compared to XML. XML and LCM, however, serve very different
    functions. XML is designed to facilitate data interchange between
    agents whose internal representations may be otherwise
    incompatible. The verbosity and generic structure of XML are aids
    for agents to use information that they understand while safely
    skipping over properties that are alien to them. In contrast, LCM
    is designed for agents that are tightly coupled but that may not
    be in the same memory space. A more rigid type definition, along
    with space-efficient and computationally-efficient encodings, are
    better fits for these types of applications.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id413411"></a><h2>Type Specifications</h2>
<p>
    Type specifications are contained in files with an ".lcm" file
    type. They are conventionally named in lower case with underscores
    between words: e.g., the type "wind_speed_t" is defined in the
    file "wind_speed_t.lcm". The utility <span class="emphasis"><em>lcm-gen</em></span>
    converts an LCM type specification into a language-dependent
    implementation.
  </p>
<div class="refsect2" lang="en">
<a name="id413426"></a><h3>Structs</h3>
<p>LCM structs are compound types consisting of other types. We
      begin with a simple struct named "temperature_t" that contains a
      64 bit integer named "utime" and a 64 bit floating point number
      named "degCelsius". Two types of comments are also illustrated.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      struct temperature_t 
      {
          int64_t   utime;         // Timestamp, in microseconds

          /* Temperature in degrees Celsius. A "float" would probably
           * be good enough, unless we're measuring temperatures during
           * the big bang. Note that the asterisk on the beginning of this
           * line is not syntactically necessary, it's just pretty.
           */
          double    degCelsius;    
      }
    </pre>
<p>
      This declaration must appear in a file named "temperature_t.lcm".
    </p>
<p>LCM types do not contain pointers (but arrays are supported, see
      below): this eliminates the possibility of circular references.
    </p>
<p>Before we go further, let's take a look at the various
      primitive types available.</p>
<div class="refsect3" lang="en">
<a name="id412871"></a><h4>Primitive Types</h4>
<p>LCM supports a number of primitive types: int8_t, int16_t,
	int32_t, int64_t, byte, float, double, string, and boolean. The
	integer types are all signed (as is necessary to ensure easy
	inter-operation with Java, which lacks unsigned types) and are
	encoded in network byte order.</p>
<p>The type 'byte' is encoded the same way as int8_t. However,
	there are instances in which buffers of data (such as a JPEG
	image) must be sent across the network. These buffers of data
	must be decoded by some additional software. The type 'byte' can
	be used by a type designer to help convey the notion that the
	data is opaque, and should not be interpreted (literally) as an
	array of 8 bit integers.
      </p>
<p>Floating point types are encoded using the IEEE 32 and 64
	bit formats. An LCM implementation may not use any other
	encoding. The 32 and 64 bit quantities are transmitted in
	network byte order.
      </p>
<p>The boolean type is encoded as a single byte whose value is
	either 0 or 1. An array of N booleans will require N bytes.
      </p>
<p>The string type encodes a NULL-terminated UTF-8 string. The
	string is sent as a 32 bit integer comprising the total length of
	string in bytes (including terminating NULL character) followed by
	the bytes of the string (again, including the NULL character).
      </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect3" lang="en">
<a name="id412908"></a><h4>Arrays</h4>
<p>
	LCM supports multi-dimensional arrays consisting of
	primitives, structs, or constant declarations. The number of
	dimensions in the array are declared by the LCM type
	declaration: you cannot encode an LCM type that consists of a
	variable-dimension array. In contrast, variable-sized arrays
	are fine. Consider this example:
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
	struct point2d_list_t
        {
	   int32_t npoints;
	   double  points[npoints][2];
        }
      </pre>
<p>
	This example shows a two-dimensional array declaration
	consisting of both variable-length and fixed-length
	components. In a variable-length declaration, the variable
	that contains the length must be declared prior to its use as
	an array length. Also note that the length variable (npoints,
	in the example above) must be an integer type, and must always
	have a value greater than or equal to zero.
      </p>
<p>
	When arrays are encoded and decoded, each dimension's size is
	already known: it is either a constant (given by the LCM type
	declaration), or it was a previously encoded/decoded
	variable. Thus, an array is encoded simply by recursively
	encoding each element of the array, with inner-most dimensions
	being encoded together. In other words, the array above would
	be encoded in the order points[0][0], points[0][1],
	points[1][0], points[1][1], points[2][0], points[2][1], etc.
      </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="refsect2" lang="en">
<a name="id412942"></a><h3>Constants</h3>
<p>
      LCM provides a simple way of declaring constants that can
      subsequently be used to populate other data fields. Users are
      free to use these constants in any way they choose: as magic
      numbers, enumerations, or bitfields.
    </p>
<p>
      Constants can be declared by using the const keyword.

      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
	const int32_t YELLOW=1, GOLDENROD=2, CANARY=3;
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>
<p>
      Note that types must be declared for constants. All integer and
      floating point types are supported. Note that string constants
      are not supported, since strings are not simple value types on
      many platforms.

<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id412974"></a><h2>Namespaces</h2>
<p>
    LCM allows types to be defined in a namespace, making it easier
    for users to use types from other organizations even if those
    types have the same name. The namespace mechanism is closely
    modeled after that of Java. In languages that support namespaces
    (such as Java and Python), the LCM namespace mechanism is mapped onto the
    native mechanism. In languages like C, namespaces are approximated by
    prepending the package name to the type name. See below for an
    example of namespaces. Note that the package keyword identifies
    the namespace of the structs defined in that file, and that
    fully-qualified types are formed by concatenating the package and
    type name, with a period between.
  </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
    package mycorp;

    struct camera_image_t {
       int64_t      utime;
       string       camera_name;
       jpeg.image_t jpeg_image;
       mit.pose_t   pose;
    }
  </pre>
<p>
    LCM users are encouraged to put their types into a unique
    namespace and to fully-qualify the types of all the member
    fields.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id413001"></a><h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
<p>
    The runtime costs of encoding and decoding with LCM are generally
    not a system bottleneck. The marshalling functions are
    dramatically faster than an XML implementation, but since each
    member must be individually processed (in order to ensure correct
    byte ordering, for example), LCM is more expensive than using raw
    C structs. That said, LCM's first application used over 40MB/s.
  </p>

<a name="id413030"></a><h2>Appendix 1: Fingerprint Computation</h2>
<p>
    Fingerprints ensure that the encoding and decoding methods agree on
    the format of a data type. The fingerprints are a function,
    recursively, of all of the types that a type contains. This creates a
    potential problem when types could be mutually recursive: we must
    avoid an infinite recursion.
  </p>
<p>
    The basic idea is for each type to have a "base" fingerprint, which
    we'll denote for type "A" as "K_A". K_A is a constant derived from the
    lcm type description (and it's stored as lcm_struct-&gt;hash). We wish to
    compute the actual fingerprint (or hash), A(), which is a function of
    all of A's contained types.
  </p>
<p>
    In addition, so that we can recognize a recursion, the A() function
    takes an argument, which is a list of the types already visited. E.g.,
    C(&lt;A,B&gt;) indicates that we wish to compute the hash of type C, given
    that C is a member of type B, which is a member of type A.  We avoid
    recursions by setting C(&lt;list&gt;) = 0 if &lt;list&gt; contains C. 
  </p>
<p>
    The contribution of primitive types is handled via the K_A; there is
    no recursion for them.
  </p>
<p>
    A small wrinkle arises from the above definitions: if types A, B, and
    C are mutually recursive, we can have two types with the same
    hash. This is clearly undesirable. We fix this by making the order of
    recursion relevant: at each node in the tree, we rotate the value
    (bitwise) 1 bit to the left. A type that is included at recursion
    depth N has its contribution rotated by N bits.
  </p>
<p>
    Note that this mechanism is entirely unnecessary for enumerations
    (they cannot contain other types); for enumerations, we just use the
    hash in lcmenum-&gt;hash.
  </p>
<p>PSEUDO-CODE </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
  v = compute_hash(type, parents)
  
  if type is member of parents
     return 0

  v = K_type;

  for each members m of type
      v += compute_hash(m, &lt;parents, type&gt;)

  return rot_left(v);
</pre>
<p>
  When encoding/decode a type T, we would use compute_hash(T,
  &lt;&gt;) as the hash function.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
struct A
{
        B b;
        C c;
}

struct B
{
        A a;
}

struct C
{
        B b;
}
</pre>
<p>
  Diagrammatically, we can compute their hashes by showing the children
  of each branch. We use lower case to indicate a terminal leaf (where
  the leaf is the same class as one of its parents).
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
         A                B                  C
       /   \              |                  |
      B     C             A                  B
      |     |            / \                 |
      a     B           b   C                A
            |               |               / \
            a               b              b   c

A() = R{K_A + R{K_B}} + R{K_C + R{K_B}}}

B() = R{K_B + R{K_A + R{K_C}}}

C() = R{K_C + R{K_B + R{K_A}}}
</pre>
<p>
  Note that without the rotations, B() == C().
