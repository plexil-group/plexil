Inter-Process Communications (IPC)
----------------------------------

The IPC library is a package for doing efficient, network-based inter-process
message passing.  IPC supports both publish/subscribe and client/server
paradigms.  It also provides efficient marshalling and unmarshalling of
complex data structures.  IPC is based on the communications package of the
Task Control Architecture (TCA), with extensions to support the NASA New
Millennium Program.

For a detailed description of IPC, see the programmers guide in the doc
directory.

To compile IPC, you should just have to do "gmake install" from this directory.
For more detailed instructions on compiling IPC, see the INSTALL file in the
src directory.

The current version of IPC has been run on the following machines types:

sparc running SunOs 4.1.3
sparc running Solaris
i486, i586 running Linux
SGI Personal Iris 
i486, i586 running Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95
Macintosh, including OSX (see README.MAC)

The system should run on any machine that supports sockets and has a C
compiler.  For information in porting IPC to a new architecture, contact
Reid Simmons (reids@cs.cmu.edu).

There are several sets of "makefiles" in these directories.  The
GNUmakefiles are for use with the GNU project make (gmake).  These are
the most comprehensive makefiles.  The "Makefiles" are the most generic.
Other files can are specialized to a specific architecture, but these
often get out of date.  Try the GNUmakefiles first, then the Makefiles
and finally any other random files.

An older version of the instructions for compiling IPC is available in
README.old.  This files also contains instructions for running some of
the example test programs.  As of this time, not all the test programs
have been tested with the current version.
