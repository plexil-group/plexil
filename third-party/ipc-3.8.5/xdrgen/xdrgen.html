<h1><code>xdrgen</code> Documentation</h1>

<h2>Purpose of <code>xdrgen</code></h2>

Defining an IPC message requires a format string which corresponds to
the data structure of the message.  Typically, the designer of the
message has defined this format string by hand, as a macro in the same
header file which defines the data structure.  The <code>xdrgen</code>
parser automates this process.  It parses an XDR data structure
specification (similar to a list of C type definitions), and generates a
C header which includes both type definitions and macros defining
the IPC format strings.<p>

Automating this process helps to avoid inconsistencies between the C
data structure and the IPC format string.  In our experience,
inconsistencies are often introduced when the data structure is changed,
but the person modifying the code is not aware that the format string
must also be changed.  These inconsistencies can lead to garbled binary
messages, which are sometimes very difficult to track down.<p>

<h2>Running <code>xdrgen</code> for the first time</h2>

Installing IPC will place an <code>xdrgen</code> binary in the same
location as the central server.  To see an example run of
<code>xdrgen</code>, run the following command in the <code>src/XDRGen</code>
directory of the IPC distribution:<p>

<code>xdrgen example.xdr example.xdr.h</code><p>

This will output the C header file <code>example.xdr.h</code>, based on
the XDR specification in <code>example.xdr</code>.  You can compare the
two to get a quick idea of the relationship between XDR and C.<p>

<h2><code>xdrgen</code> command-line options</h2>

<pre>
usage: xdrgen <var>OPTIONS</var> &lt;<var>xdrFile</var>&gt; [<var>outputHeaderFile</var>]
 -h or --help        Print this help
 --lang=[c,c++]      Change language for header output
                     (default: c++)
 --directives=[portable,gcc,none]
                     Control syntax of #line directives
                     that help to trace location of errors
                     (default: portable)
 -D<var>name</var>=<var>value</var>, -I<var>directory</var>
                     These options are passed on to the C
                     pre-processor before xdrgen parses the
                     input file (see cpp(1) or 'info cpp')
</pre>

When <code>xdrgen</code> is run, it will parse <var>xdrFile</var> and
output the resulting C header to <var>outputHeaderFile</var> (or to
<code>stdout</code> if <var>outputHeaderFile</var> isn't specified).
Specifying C++ for the header output language (the default) will cause
the header to use some C++ language features which are not supported by
C.  The differences will be discussed more later.<p>

<h2>Basic <code>xdrgen</code> type declarations</h2>

We now move onto the kinds of declarations which <code>xdrgen</code> can
parse.  There are two basic kinds of declarations.  The first is a
<code>typedef</code>.  The declaration<p>

<pre>
typedef int foo;
</pre><p>

generates a <code>typedef</code> and a macro in the output header file:<p>

<pre>
typedef int foo;
#define foo_IPC_FORMAT "int"
</pre><p>

The second kind of declaration is a <code>struct</code>.  The
declaration<p>

<pre>
struct Zoo {
  int foo;
  int goo;
};
</pre>

generates a <code>struct</code> and a macro in the output header file:<p>

<pre>
typedef struct _Zoo {
  int foo;
  int goo;
} Zoo;
#define Zoo_IPC_FORMAT "{int,int}"
</pre>

If the header language is C++, the generated code is slightly different:<p>

<pre>
struct Zoo {
  int foo;
  int goo;
#define Zoo_IPC_FORMAT "{int,int}"
  static const char *getIPCFormat(void) {
    return Zoo_IPC_FORMAT;
  }
};
</pre><p>

If you are using a C++ compiler, the C++ output has the following
advantages:
<ul>
  <li> As we will see later, <code>xdrgen</code> allows arbitrary code
       to be inserted at the end of a struct definition.  In C++, this
       can be used to define member functions.  Defining the
       <code>struct</code> starting with <code>struct Zoo</code> instead
       of <code>typedef struct _Zoo</code> allows us to define
       constructors for <code>Zoo</code> in the arbitrary
       code section.
  <li> Code which requires the IPC format can access either the
       macro <code>Zoo_IPC_FORMAT</code> or the member function
       <code>Zoo::getIPCFormat()</code>, which may enable you to write
       cleaner code.
</ul><p>

You may nest <code>struct</code> declarations to arbitrary depths, and
use previously defined types in declarations of new types, as in the
following:<p>

<pre>
struct MyIncludableStruct {
  int foo;
  struct { int a; } goo;
};

struct MyNestedStruct {
  MyIncludableStruct b;
  struct {
    char a;
    MyIncludableStruct b2;
  } roo;
};
</pre><p>

You may not declare multiple fields of the same type in one line, so
the C construction <code>int a, b;</code> must be replaced with
<code>int a; int b;</code>.

<h2>Primitive types</h2>

The following struct definition has fields with all of the supported
primitive types:<p>

<pre>
struct PrimitiveTypes {
  string a&lt;&gt;;
  unsigned char b;
  char c;
  unsigned int d;
  int e;
  bool f;
  float g;
  double h;
};
</pre>

Some notes about how these types are used:
<ul>
  <li> The <code>string</code> field is followed by &lt;&gt; because
       strings are always variable-length arrays in XDR.  This will be
       discussed more later.
  <li> The <code>bool</code> type isn't defined by default in C.
       Therefore, whenever <code>xdrgen</code> creates C-language
       output, it includes a definition for <code>bool</code>
       as an enumerated type compatible with the built-in C++ definition.
       In C++, a <code>bool</code> is a 4-byte data structure which
       takes on the values <code>false</code>=0 or <code>true</code>=1.
       In the IPC format string, the <code>bool</code> field is
       represented as <code>"int"</code>
  <li> For the other types, there is a straightforward mapping both to C
       datatypes and to IPC format strings (see the <em>Defining Message
       Data Formats</em> section).
</ul>

<h2>Fixed-length arrays</h2>

Fixed length arrays in the XDR file are mapped directly to fixed-length
arrays in C.  For the XDR declarations<p>

<pre>
typedef unsigned char ImagePixel[3];

struct Transform {
  double mat[4][4];
};
</pre><p>

we get the following header output (abbreviated for clarity):<p>

<pre>
typedef unsigned char ImagePixel[3];
#define ImagePixel_IPC_FORMAT "[uchar:3]"

struct Transform {
  double mat[4][4];
};
#define Transform_IPC_FORMAT "{[double:4,4]}"
</pre><p>

<h2>Variable-length arrays</h2>

Variable-length arrays are specified in XDR using angle brackets
&lt;&gt;.  For the XDR declaration<p>

<pre>
struct Image {
  int rows;
  int cols;
  unsigned char data&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;;
};
</pre><p>

we get the following header output (abbreviated for clarity):<p>

<pre>
struct Image {
  int rows;
  int cols;
  unsigned char *data;
};
#define Image_IPC_FORMAT "{int,int,&lt;uchar:1,2&gt;}"
</pre><p>

Variable-length array fields in IPC must be inside a
<code>struct</code>, and the length in each dimension of the array must
correspond to an <code>int</code> or <code>unsigned int</code> field of
the <code>struct</code>.  Which fields of the
<code>struct</code> are used for each dimension is controlled by the
format string.  <code>xdrgen</code> has the following stricter
requirements:
<ul>
  <li> If the variable-length array has <var>n</var> dimensions, the
       struct must have exactly <var>n</var>+1 fields.
  <li> The first <var>n</var> fields of the struct must have type
       <code>int</code> or <code>unsigned int</code>
  <li> The <code>int</code> fields of the struct correspond to
       dimensions of the array in order from left to right (most
       significant dimension to least significant).
</ul>

<code>xdrgen</code> is designed this way to make it clear where the size
of each dimension of the array is coming from, and remove the need for
extra language features to specify how <code>int</code> fields
correspond to array dimensions.  This simplicity comes at the cost of
discarding some of IPC's flexibility.<p>

Fixed and variable-length array dimensions cannot be mixed, so the
following declaration is illegal:<p>

<pre>
struct Alpha {
  int size;
  char beta[5]&lt;&gt;;
}
</pre><p>

However, a similar effect could be achieved with the following
declaration:<p>

<pre>
struct Alpha {
  int size;
  struct { char data[5]; } beta&lt;&gt;;
};
</pre><p>

<code>xdrgen</code> allows a maximum possible length to be declared for
a variable-length array, as in the following definition:<p>

<pre>
struct Gamma {
  int delta;
  float epsilon&lt;20&gt;;
};
</pre><p>

However, there is no notion of a maximum length for a variable-length
array in IPC, so the length doesn't currently appear in the header
output.

<h2>Enumerated types</h2>

Enumerated types in XDR are mapped directly to enumerated types in C.
From the declaration<p>

<pre>
enum Color {
  RED, ORANGE, YELLOW
};
</pre><p>

we get the following header output:

<pre>
enum Color {
  RED,
  ORANGE,
  YELLOW
};
#define Color_IPC_FORMAT "{enum RED,ORANGE,YELLOW}"
</pre><p>

Values for the named options of an enumerated type can also be
specified, but IPC is only flexible enough to handle a consecutive set
of options, so if any values are specified, <code>xdrgen</code>
represents the field as <code>"int"</code> to IPC (with the disadvantage
that IPC can't expand values to option names during data logging).  For
the declaration<p>

<pre>
enum Mixed {
  TWO = 2, FOUR, SIX = 6
};
</pre><p>

we get the following header output:

<pre>
enum Mixed {
  TWO = 2,
  FOUR,
  SIX = 6
};
#define Mixed_IPC_FORMAT "int"
</pre><p>

<h2>More about the <code>string</code> type</h2>

Strings are a special case.  A string is a null-terminated array of
<code>char</code>.  IPC doesn't need to have an integer dimension for
the size of the array because it can detect the size from the null
termination.  Therefore the last variable-length dimension of a string.
<ul>
  <li> is required to be present (as specified in RFC 1014)
  <li> is ignored in the IPC format generated by xdrgen
  <li> does not need to appear in a struct with a corresponding
       <code>int</code> field
</ul>
Also, fixed- and variable-length arrays of strings are allowed, as in
the following definition:<p>

<pre>
struct ExecCall {
  struct {
    int argc;
    string argv&lt;&gt;;
  } args;
  string envVars[20]&lt;&gt;;
};
</pre><p>

which produces the header output (abbreviated for clarity):<p>

<pre>
struct ExecCall {
  struct {
    int argc;
    char **argv;
  } args;
  char *envVars[20];
};
#define ExecCall_IPC_FORMAT "{{int,&lt;string:1&gt;},[string:20]}"
</pre><p>

<h2>Arbitrary code sections</h2>

Your XDR file can include arbitrary code sections wrapped in the
delimiters <code>%{</code> and <code>%}</code>.  Arbitrary code can be
placed at the beginning or end of the file, between declarations, or at
the end of a <code>struct</code> declaration, just before the closing
<code>}</code> character.  The arbitrary code will be copied into the
generated header at the corresponding point in the C code.<p>

The XDR file text<p>

<pre>
%{
#include "my_arbitrary_code.h"
#define N 3
extern int foo;
%}

typedef double Meters;

%{
extern Meters length;
%}

struct Roo {
  int a;
  char b;
%{
  Roo(int _a, char _b) { a = _a; b = _b; }
%}
};
</pre><p>

generates the header output (abbreviated for clarity):<p>

<pre>
#include "my_arbitrary_code.h"
#define N 3
extern int foo;

typedef double Meters;
#define Meters_IPC_FORMAT "double"

extern Meters length;

struct Roo {
  int a;
  char b;
  Roo(int _a, char _b) { a = _a; b = _b; }
};
#define Roo_IPC_FORMAT "{int,char}"
</pre><p>

<h2>External format definitions</h2>

You can use external format definitions if the structs you define
using XDR contain other datatypes which are not defined using XDR.
This could happen if you want to manually define the IPC format for a
datatype using an IPC feature not supported by <code>xdrgen</code>.

The declaration<p>

<pre>
ipc_type ExternalStruct1;
</pre><p>

tells <code>xdrgen</code> to expect that the type
<code>ExternalStruct1</code> has an IPC format defined in the macro
<code>ExternalStruct1_IPC_FORMAT</code>.  The macro definition must
appear before the generated code for any <code>struct</code> which
includes <code>ExternalStruct1</code>, which means that it should either
appear in an arbitrary code section of the XDR file, or it should be
included via a <code>#include</code> directive in an arbitrary code
section.<p>

Once <code>ExternalStruct1</code> is declared using
<code>ipc_type</code>, it can be included in subsequent
<code>struct</code> declarations without causing a warning.
The declaration<p>

<pre>
struct IncExternalStruct {
  int a;
  ExternalStruct1 s1;
}
</pre><p>

generates the header output (abbreviated for clarity):<p>

<pre>
struct IncExternalStruct {
  int a;
  ExternalStruct1 s1;
}
#define IncExternalStruct_IPC_FORMAT "{int," ExternalStruct1_IPC_FORMAT "}"
</pre><p>

You can also manually define the IPC format for a type using
<code>ipc_type</code>.  The declaration<p>

<pre>
ipc_type ExternalStruct2 = "{char,double}";
</pre><p>

tells <code>xdrgen</code> to use the given format string instead of
trying to refer to the macro <code>ExternalStruct2_IPC_FORMAT</code>.<p>

<h2>Formal XDR language definition</h2>

The <code>xdrgen</code> parser aims to parse the XDR language (as
specified by Sun Microsystems in <a
href="http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1014.html">RFC 1014</a> )
wherever this makes sense.  However, there are both unsupported features
and extensions in the <code>xdrgen</code> input language:
<ul>
  <li> RFC 1014 specifies a mapping between an XDR datatype
       specification and
       the binary format of the corresponding network message.  Because
       XDR syntax is so similar to C syntax, there is also an implicit
       mapping between the XDR datatype and the corresponding C
       datatype.  It is this second mapping that <code>xdrgen</code>
       tries to capture.  The IPC format string for a datatype is
       generated from the C datatype according to the rules in the
       <em>Defining Message Data Formats</em> section.
       There is no reason to expect that IPC network
       messages will follow the XDR binary packing rules.
  <li> Unsupported feature: <code>union</code> types.  There are no
       corresponding types in IPC.
  <li> Unsupported feature: <code>hyper</code> (8-byte integer) types.
       There are no corresponding types in IPC.
  <li> Unsupported feature: optional data (the XDR <code>*</code>
       syntax).  Supported in IPC, but not implemented by <code>xdrgen</code>.
  <li> Extension: <code>opaque</code> replaced with <code>char</code>
       and <code>unsigned char</code>.  A <code>char</code> type need
       not be in an array.
  <li> Extension: arbitrary code sections.
  <li> Extension: multi-dimensional arrays.
</ul><p>

Those interested in a full grammar for the <code>xdrgen</code> input
language can look at <code>bison</code> input file
<code>src/XDRGen/XDR.y</code> in the IPC distribution.<p>
