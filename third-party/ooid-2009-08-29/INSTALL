As this is a small piece of software, we do not provide any configure script
or makefile. This is a header-only library, to make use of it you should copy
the kashmir directory to a location that is visible to your preprocessor and
include the proper header in your code.

* uuid.h : the uuid_t class implements a type compliant to RFC 4122. It was a
design decision to make uuid_t resemble a built-in type as much as possible, so
we limit the interface to: a predicate test for nil; comparison operators that
define a total order; and stream operators to expose the standard character
string representation XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX.

In particular, we do not provide direct access to the internal
data

* devrandom.h : provides a random stream using the /dev/urandom file nowadays
implemented in many UNIX flavors.

* winrandom.h : implements a random stream in Windows with CryptGenRandom.

* winrand.h : like the above, but uses an undocumented "shortcut" that avoids
the overhead implied by loading the WinCrypt API.

* randomstream.h : you need to directly include this file if you want to adapt
a PRNG different from those listed above. In this case you should implement a
class derived from randomstream via "curiously recurring template pattern" and 
code the appropriate read method. Be aware that the wrapped PRNG dictates the
"quality" of the data extracted from the resulting stream.
