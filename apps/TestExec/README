This directory contains TestExec, a "test executive" for PLEXIL.  It
contains the TestExec application, which combines the UE and a simple
simulator into a single executable, as well as plans, simulation
scripts, and utilities for running regression tests.

See the UE reference manual for detailed information:

In particular, instructions and usages for TestExec are found in these chapters:

  http://plexil.wiki.sourceforge.net/Basic+UE+Operation
  http://plexil.wiki.sourceforge.net/Simulating+Plan+Execution

This manual is included in PDF format in PLEXIL distributions.
