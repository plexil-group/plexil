This directory contains a regression test suite and script for the
Plexil executive.  Type './run-tests' to run the regression tests.

By default, the scripts in this directory use the executable file
../../src/apps/TestExec/TestExec, if it exists, or ../../bin/TestExec.
If this executable is installed in a different location, or you wish
to substitute an alternative executive (e.g. PLEXIL5), you can set it
with:

EXEC_PROG='/location/of/TestExec'
export EXEC_PROG

prior to running tests.
