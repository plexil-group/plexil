This directory contains a prototype Universal Executive
application that interfaces through the "IPC" (Inter-Process
Communications) package, a library for efficient,
network-based inter-process message passing, developed at
Carnegie Mellon University.  See plexil/third-party/ipc, which
has more information and the latest distribution of this
package.

An instance of this UE can communicate with other UE instances
via string-based messages.  The communication protocol is
"publish/subscribe" -- messages are published to a central IPC
server, and all executives connected to the server, except the
sender, receive the message.

The Standard (Extended) PLEXIL construct for sending messages
is the command:

  SendMessage(<string>)

And for receiving messages, the boolean expression:

  MessageReceived(<string>)

See the 'plans' directory for several examples.
