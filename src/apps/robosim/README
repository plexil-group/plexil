This directory contains a simple 2D graphical robot simulator, as a PLEXIL
application.  For more information, see the Robosim chapter in the PLEXIL manual
at http://plexil.sourceforge.net.

To build this application, type 'make'.

To run this application, first start IPC:

 ipc

Then, in a separate shell, start the robot simulator:

 robosim

Finally, run a plan of your choice, using the interface-config.xml file
in this directory.  For example, in this directory, you can type:

  plexilexec -p plans/FourStepsSimple.plx -c interface-config.xml

Note that 'interface-config.xml' is a default, so you can also just type:

  plexilexec -p plans/FourStepsSimple.plx

CAVEAT: Several of the plans are not working, due to a communications (IPC)
related problem that has recently been unsuccessfully debugged.  Namely,
array-valued return values from commands are getting dropped and effectively
hanging the plan.  The plans that presently work are: OneStep, FourStepsSimple,
and RoboSimSimple.
