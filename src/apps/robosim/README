This directory contains a simple 2D graphical robot simulator,
as a PLEXIL application.  For more information, see the
Robosim chapter in the PLEXIL manual at
http://plexil.sourceforge.net.

To build this application, type 'make'.

To run this application, first start IPC:

 ipc

Then, in a separate shell, start the robot simulator:

 robosim

Finally, run a plan of your choice, using the interface-config.xml file
in this directory.  For example, in this directory, you can type:

  plexilexec -p plans/FourSteps.plx -c interface-config.xml

Note that 'interface-config.xml' is a default, so you can also simply type:

  plexilexec -p plans/FourSteps.plx
