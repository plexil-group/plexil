This directory contains PLEXIL's temporal viewer for plans.

To use the viewer:

1. Run 'make' in plexil/src/interfaces/GanttListener to build
   the Listener for the application.

2. Add '<Listener ListenerType="GanttListener" />' to an
   interface configuration XML file associated with any
   plan(s) you wish to test with the viewer.

3. Run the plans you want to test with the viewer.

4. Open the HTML file that is stored in the same directory
   that you run plans from; each HTML file corresponds to the
   execution of a single plan. 

NOTE: It is recommended that you use Mozilla Firefox or
Safari. Google Chrome is not supported. The naming convention
for HTML files is 'Gantt_x_y.html' where 'x' is the system
time of the plan's execution and 'y' is the name of root node
in the executed plan. JSON files associated with each plan are
stored in plexil/src/viewer/json with the naming convention
'x_y.html' where 'x' and 'y' are as stated above.
