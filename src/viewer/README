This directory contains PLEXIL's temporal viewer for plans.

To use the viewer:

1. Add '<Listener ListenerType="GanttListener"/>' to an interface
   configuration XML file associated with any plan(s) you wish to
   examine with the viewer.

2. Run the desired plans, using 'plexilexec' from the command line, or
   the 'plexilexec' configuration from the Plexil Viewer.  NOTE:
   plexiltest and plexilsim are not currently supported.

3. Open the newly created HTML file(s) to view the Gantt chart.  These
   files are found in directory from which you ran Plexil.  Each HTML
   file corresponds to the execution of a single plan. The naming
   convention for HTML files is 'Gantt_x_y.html' where 'x' is the system
   time of the plan's execution and 'y' is the name of root node in the
   executed plan. JSON files associated with each plan are stored in
   plexil/src/viewer/json with the naming convention 'x_y.html' where
   'x' and 'y' are as stated above.

NOTE: We recommend you use Mozilla Firefox or Safari. Google Chrome is
not supported.
