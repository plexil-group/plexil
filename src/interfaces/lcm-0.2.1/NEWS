===========

    Release 0.1.1:

    * C: Modify "file://" provider so that lcm_handle returns -1 on EOF.
      Suppress warning messages when event numbers in a logfile are not 
      consecutive

      lcm_eventlog_t
    * lcm-logger: add option to log only channels matching a regex

Aug 29, 2008
============

    Release 0.1.0:

    New features

    * Added const declaration to .lcm specification.
    * Removed transmit_only option from LCM URL.  All LCM instances are now 
      considered transmit only until a channel subscription is made.
    * Added LCM_DEFAULT_URL environment variable.  If the LCM URL is not 
      specified during instantiation, and LCM_DEFAULT_URL is defined, then 
      that is used as the LCM URL initialization string.
    * Added documentation for LCM type specification language.
    * Added close method to Java LCM class.

    Deprecations

    * enum is now deprecated in the .lcm specification.  Current implementations
      will be left functional, but enums will no longer be documented or supported
      in future releases.  At some point in the distant future they may be 
      completely removed.  Use of const instead of enums is now recommended.

    Bugfixes

    * Java: fix enum types.  This breaks the API for compiled Java enum types.
      Changed java enum value field from private to public so that raw
      numerical value is accessible.
    * C: lcm_udp bugfix to eliminate a corner-case infinite loop.
    * C: add mutex to allow only one thread in lcm_handle at a time.

===========

    Release 0.0.5:

    * Fix minor issue in lcm-gen for parsing oddly formatted files 
      (those missing token delimiters at EOF)
    * Fix Python enum types.  This breaks the API for compiled Python enum
      types.
    * fix VERSION bug in ac_python_devel.m4 (affects OS X)
    * Remove a DGC hack that skipped over log gaps > 0.25 seconds
    * Try to make JAR file only contain class files, by using build directory
    * make lcm-spy more robust to receipt of non-lcm autogenerated types

Mar 21, 2008
============

    Release 0.0.4:

    * Portability improvements.  Core functionality is now tested on FreeBSD,
      Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris 10, and cygwin.
