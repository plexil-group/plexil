This directory contains libraries that perform various common
interfacing tasks.  

It includes the open source package LCM (Lightweight Communication and
Marshalling, http://lcm.googlecode.com/) which is at present used
exclusively for interfacing the UE with the Standalone Simulator.  LCM
has insallation prerequisites which we have found typically
pre-installed on Linux systems, but not in Mac OS.  See the UE Reference
Manual for more information.

It includes the open source package IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc/.  This is currently used to support a
new multi-executive prototype that is being developed and will be
released when ready.  This directory is not currently used by anything
in the PLEXIL distribution and may be ignored.

To build this directory without LCM, type 'make'.

To build this directory with LCM, type 'make all'.

See Makefile for more options.

The CORBA code that used to live in this directory has been moved to
../CORBA.
