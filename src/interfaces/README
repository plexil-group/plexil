This directory contains libraries that perform various common
interfacing tasks.  

The GanttListener subdirectory allows plan execution to be visualized
after plan completion. This is meant to be used with the Javascript
code in the $PLEXIL_HOME/GanttViewer directory. Caveat: this code is
known to be buggy.

The IpcAdapter subdirectory provides a general purpose interface to
other systems, from a Plexil-centric viewpoint.  It uses the open
source package TCA-IPC (Inter-Process Communication), which is
available from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc/, and which is also included
in this distribution as plexil/third-party/ipc.

The IpcUtils subdirectory contains classes and functions of use to
both the IpcAdapter and external systems that use IPC to interface to
the Plexil exec.

The LuvListener subdirectory is an older version that is only used at
present by the single-threaded TestExec application.  Please use the
version in plexil/src/app-framework for new development.

The PlanDebugListener subdirectory provides reporting to standard
output of node state transitions and other events.

The Sockets subdirectory contains C++ socket utility classes.  They
are derived from an open source package whose origins have been
forgotten.  Please let us know if you are aware of the origins of this
code.

The UdpAdapter subdirectory provides the ability to communicate with
other Plexil executives, either on the same host or across a network,
using the Universal Datagram Protocol (UDP).
