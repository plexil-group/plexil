This directory contains libraries that perform various common
interfacing tasks.  

The CORBA code that used to live in this directory has been moved to
../CORBA.

The Common subdirectory contains a previous version of the code that
now lives in plexil/src/app-framework.  It is here for backward
compatibility for older applications and is no longer supported.  New
applications should use the versions in plexil/src/app-framework.

The IpcAdapter subdirectory provides a general purpose interface to
other systems, from a Plexil-centric viewpoint.  It uses the open
source package TCA-IPC (Inter-Process Communication), which is
available from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ipc/, and which is also included
in this distribution as plexil/third-party/ipc.

The LuvListener subdirectory is an older version that is only used at
present by the single-threaded TestExec application.  Please use the
version in plexil/src/app-framework for new development.

The Sockets subdirectory contains C++ socket utility classes.  They
are derived from an open source package whose origins have been
forgotten.  Please let us know if you are aware of the origins of this
code.
