This directory contains PlexiLisp, an Emacs Lisp based syntax, and XML
generator, for PLEXIL plans and simulation scripts.  For more
information see:

  http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/plexil/index.php?title=Programming_in_Plexilisp

PlexiLisp uses the 'xmlformat' XML parser (Copyright (c) 2004, 2005,
Kitebird, LLC.  All rights reserved.).  The license agreement for
'xmlformat' is found in the file 'xmlformat-license.txt'.


NOTE: In some version of Emacs there are compiler warnings that are
apparently spurious.  The following is one example:

Compiling file plexil/plexilisp/plexil.el at Thu May 15 17:29:53 2008
  ** The function `run-mode-hooks' is not known to be defined.

Please report any problems to plexil-support@sourceforge.net.
