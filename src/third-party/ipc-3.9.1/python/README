The Python version of IPC has currently been tested only under Linux.

To make IPC for Python on your system, you will need SWIG (currently tested
using version 1.3.40).  With SWIG installed, you just type "gmake install"
and everything should happen automatically.  After completing, you should
have IPC.py in this directory and _IPC.so in the ../lib/<sys> directory
(where <sys> is Linux-2.6, for instance).

To run the Python IPC, you need to set the PYTHONPATH environment
variable to include both this directory and the directory where _IPC.so is
found (see above). 
> setenv PYTHONPATH "${PYTHONPATH}:${HOME}/code/ipc/lib/Linux-2.6:${HOME}/code/ipc/python"

There are Python test programs in the ipc/test directory to give you some
indication of how to use the Python version of IPC.  The manual has more
complete instructions.
