	      Installation instructions for IPC (C/Unix users)


Making IPC for Unix is quite simple:

gmake depend
gmake install

To make the IPC libraries useable by Allegro Common Lisp:
1) Find out where Allegro is kept on your machine.  Edit the file
   src/GNUmakefile and change the variable LISP_INC_DIR to reflect where the
   LISP include files are found in your environment.

2) Compile using "gmake USE_LISP=1 install", *or* edit src/GNUmakefile and
   uncomment the line containing USE_LISP.

For vxworks:
  gmake VX=<target> install
where <target> is either M68K, PPC, or R6K (R6000)
NOTE: Currently, only VX=M68K works.  Edit the file ../etc/GNUmakefile.defs
to add other vxworks targets (and to change the M68K target to fit your
environment).

NOTE: Installation is using the GNU make facility (on some machines this is
"gmake", on some it is "make", on some it is "gnumake").

The IPC files are currently compiled with the -g option, which adds
information needed by symbolic debuggers.  You can make the library files
*much* smaller by doing "gmake DEBUG=NONE install".

See the README file for instructions on how to make programs that use the IPC.
