		Installation instructions for IPC (LISP users)

1) Find out where Allegro is kept on your machine.  Edit the file
   lisp/GNUmakefile and change the variable LISP_BIN to reflect where
   Allegro Common Lisp is found in your environment.

2) Install the C version of IPC (see ../src/INSTALL)

3) Do "gmake install" *or* run Allegro and do:
   (load "ipc-compile")

To load and run the LISP version of IPC, do:
  (load "ipc-load").  This will load all the relevant IPC LISP files,
  including the C libraries needed to run IPC.

See the README file for instructions on how to make programs that use the IPC.
