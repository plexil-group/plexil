Welcome to Plexil 2.0!

If you need the version prior to 06 February 2012, it may be checked out as:

 https://plexil.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/plexil/branches/plexil-1.7.1

New features in this release include:

 - The Plexil executive is now significantly faster, with major
 speedups in XML parsing (see below), construction of internal
 representations, and execution proper.

 - A new version of the Plexil language translator. We believe the
 revised language will be much simpler to use. The example plans have
 been updated to the new syntax. (The old translator remains, but is
 deprecated, and will no longer be supported.)

Changes include:

 - New, simpler interfacing APIs.

 - The TinyXML parser has been replaced by pugixml, which proved 20x
 faster in our testing. This was a major contributor to the improved
 performance of the executive.

 - The Plexil executive's behavior conforms more closely to its
 specification.

Not changed:

 - The Plexil XML representation has not changed. Old .plx files will
 continue to work unmodified in Plexil 2.0.

Thank you for using PLEXIL!
