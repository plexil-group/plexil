This directory contains two unrelated sets of files.

1. Documentation of the debug flags used in PLEXIL source code.

   CompleteDebugFlags.cfg - a complete listing, automatically generated.
   DebugFlagComments.txt - an annotated listing, source unknown.
   DebugFlagDefinitions - a more detailed annotated listing, source unknown.

2. Scripts that collectively generate a PDF version of Plexil's documentation
   wiki at plexil.sourceforge.net.  Not sure if these scripts still work
   (2/10/16) as they haven't been tried in a while, and the Sourceforge wiki
   installation has changed.  The remainder of this file documents these scripts.


The PDF generator described in (2) above requires the following tools:

htmldoc (http://www.htmldoc.org/software.php)
	last working version: HTMLDOC 1.8.27 
bash
	wget
	sed
	exec

Related directory contents:

docHtmlPull
	main bash script to automate all features
	also has feature to remove cleaned html and htmldoc template

parse
	sed script to clean links into usable formats based upon sourceforge
	index

PictureMan.book (generated file?)
	configuration file for htmldoc to produce standardized pdf file
	
process
	sed script to remove extraneous details from html pages


Instructions
------------

First, do this:

cd $PLEXIL_HOME/doc/
./docHtmlPull

Output file should be man.pdf

To clean up, type:

cd $PLEXIL_HOME/doc/
./docHtmlPull clean

This step:

 - Pulls all relevant links from Plexil sourceforge website index
 - downloads relevant pages based upon index into sourceforge root folder
 - builds pre-configured htmldoc template
 - cleans links based upon names
 - formats html files to build a usable index for dochtml in a clean folder
 - configures a pre-configured htmldoc template
 - passes html to htmldoc to produce PDF


CAVEAT: Wiki must NOT contain Level 1 entries, which confuse HtmlDoc.  

TODO:
  Convert bad php links to useable links by hmtldoc as references witin PDF
  simplify process sed script to use less lines of code (possibly using
  functions and variables).
