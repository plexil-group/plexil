--- Requirements ---
This Application requires the following components:

htmldoc (http://www.htmldoc.org/software.php)
	last working version: HTMLDOC 1.8.27 
bash
	wget
	sed
	exec

--- How to Use? ---
cd $PLEXIL_HOME/doc/
./docHtmlPull

output file should be man.pdf

-- Easy Cleanup --
cd $PLEXIL_HOME/doc/
./docHtmlPull clean

---Contents Include: ---
README
	this document

docHtmlPull
	main bash script to automate all features
	also has feature to remove cleaned html and htmldoc template

parse
	sed script to clean links into usable formats based upon sourceforge
	index

PictureMan.book
	configuration file for htmldoc to produce standardized pdf file
	
process
	sed script to remove extraneous details from html pages
	
--- How it Works? ---
Pulls all relevant links from Plexil sourceforge website index
downloads relevant pages based upon index into sourceforge root folder
builds pre-configured htmldoc template
cleans links based upon names
formats html files to build a usable index for dochtml in a clean folder
configures a pre-configured htmldoc template
passes html to htmldoc to produce PDF

--- Notes to future editors ---
Wiki must not contain level 1 entries otherwise confuses HtmlDoc.  

TODO:
  convert bad php links to useable links by hmtldoc as references witin PDF
  simplify process sed script to use less lines of code (possibly using
  functions and variables)
