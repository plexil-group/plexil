This is the top level directory of the PLEXIL distribution.

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/plexil for information about this
software, including its user manuals.  There is more information in
the README files found in each subdirectory of this directory.

The Versions file describes previous releases of Plexil, as well as
the latest features not yet released in a binary distribution.

The CAVEATS file describes known problems and issues in this release.


How to build PLEXIL
-------------------

If you have obtained PLEXIL as a binary distribution, there is nothing
to build.

If you have checked out source files from SVN or expanded a source
code tarball, follow these steps to build the Executive and various
support programs.

1. Set up your Unix environment. The PLEXIL build system must be told
where its files are. This example uses the Bash shell, and assumes
you've filed PLEXIL as ~/plexil-4.
 
  export PLEXIL_HOME=~/work/plexil-4

2. Build and install the binaries.

  make


Advanced builds
---------------

The PLEXIL Executive uses the GNU autotools to allow for easy
customization and cross-compilation when the standard build (above)
is not appropriate for a specific application.

The file $PLEXIL_HOME/src/build-for-buildroot.sh is an example of
cross-compiling the PLEXIL Executive for use with the 'buildroot'
embedded Linux tool suite on an ARM processor.

1. Set up your Unix environment. The PLEXIL build system must be told
where its files are. This example uses the Bash shell, and assumes
you've filed PLEXIL as ~/plexil-4.
 
   export PLEXIL_HOME=~/work/plexil-4

2. Change to the build directory.

  cd ~/plexil-4/src

3. If you are building from a fresh SVN checkout, you will need to
run the GNU autotools first. This step is unnecessary if you
downloaded a binary distribution or source tarball.

  autoreconf -f -i

4. Configure the build using the standard 'configure' script. To get a
listing of the various options, type:

  ./configure --help

The example below includes all the optional PLEXIL components as built
in the previous section, with binaries and libraries installed in the
PLEXIL installation directory.  You can omit or change options as
desired.

  ./configure --prefix=$PLEXIL_HOME --disable-static --enable-gantt --enable-ipc --enable-sas --enable-test-exec --enable-udp

5. Build and install the system:

  make install


Running PLEXIL
--------------

1. Set up your Unix environment. The PLEXIL shell scripts depend on
the setting of PLEXIL_HOME, and for convenience you will want to add
the PLEXIL scripts and binaries to your shell's path. This example is
for the Bourne shell or similar.

  export PLEXIL_HOME='/location/of/plexil'
  . $PLEXIL_HOME/scripts/plexil-setup.sh

You may wish to add these two lines to your shell init file.

2. The 'plexil' script launches the Plexil Viewer, in which you can
examine, run, and debug plans. You may wish to use the plans in the
'examples' directory as a starting point.

  plexil

3. The 'plexilc' script compiles a PLEXIL plan or Plexilscript
simulation script, depending on the file extension, to the executable
XML representation.

  plexilc my_plan.ple
