 - added RoboSim example application and plans
 - reduced response time to external world events

0.83
 - critical bug fix for event processing
 - the Node Priority clause has been deprecated.  It had semantic
   issues, and is not used in any known PLEXIL applications.  Multiple
   assignments to the same variable occuring simultaneously results in a
   runtime error.  At this stage, the Priority clause has only been
   removed from documentation and tests.  It is still implemented, as an
   undocumented and unsupported feature.  It may someday be removed from
   the implementation without notice.  A better solution may be designed.
