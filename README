This is the top level directory of the PLEXIL distribution.

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/plexil for information about this 
software, including its user manuals.  There is more information in the 
README files found in each subdirectory of this directory.

The Versions file describes previous releases of Plexil, as well as the latest
features not yet released in a binary distribution.

The CAVEATS file describes problems and issues in this release.  Please read it!

The instructions supercede those found on PLEXIL's Sourceforge wiki (4/15/14).


How to build PLEXIL
-------------------

If you have obtained PLEXIL as a binary distribution, there is nothing to build.
If you have checked it out as source code, follow these steps.

1. Setup your Unix environment.  The following two environment variable settings
are needed for building and running PLEXIL, so best to put them in your shell
init file.  This example uses the Bash shell, and assumes you've filed PLEXIL as
~/plexil-4.
 
   export PLEXIL_HOME=~/work/plexil-4
   export PATH=$PLEXIL_HOME/scripts:$PATH

1. In a Unix shell, change to the build directory

  cd ~/plexil-4/src

2. Configure for the build.  This example includes all the optional PLEXIL
components (recommended) and has binaries installed in the PLEXIL installation
directory.  You can omit or change options as desired.

  ./configure --prefix=$PLEXIL_HOME --enable-gantt --enable-module-tests --enable-test-exec --enable-udp

3. Build and install the binaries.

  make
  make install

4. Build the following PLEXIL tools individually (we'll fold them into the main
build eventually).

  cd $PLEXIL_HOME/compilers/plexil
  make

  cd $PLEXIL_HOME/compilers/plexilscript
  ant

  cd $PLEXIL_HOME/viewers/pv
  ant jar
