Release Notes
-------------

1.2  (June 2010)
 - Support for Ubuntu Linux
 - LUV (execution viewer) enhancements
   - multiple instances possible, one for each executive
   - automatically started, when requested, from run-ue and run-te scripts
 - Extended PLEXIL: 
   - new all-purpose "Lookup" form
   - Skip Condition now handled correctly in sequences
   - OnCommand, OnMessage fully integrated
 - Allow string expressions, and arrays, as command arguments
 - Cleanup of TestExec regression tests
 - Cleanup of XML schemas
 - Miscellaneous fixes throughout system
 - Reference manual revision

1.1 (April 2010)
 - Added signficant support and language features for inter-executive
   communication, with a new chapter on this feature.  In particular, executives
   can send (and respond to) messages, commands, and state lookups amongst each
   other.
 - Greatly simplified the interfacing of the PLEXIL executive with external
   systems, with a new chapter on this.  In particular:
   * universalExec executable replaces most UE application executables.
   * Interface adapters and exec listeners can be loaded dynamically from shared
     libraries at runtime, and no longer need to be built into the executable.
   * Interface manager now has getProperty() and setProperty() to allow
     communication of arbitrary data between the application, adapters, and
     listeners.
   * Exec listeners and exec listener filters' constructors are now called with
     a 2nd argument, a reference to the interface manager.
 - The LCM (Lightweight Communications and Marshalling) package has been
   completely replaced by CMU's IPC (Inter-Process Communication).  The
   applications that used LCM (standalone simulator, Robosim) now use IPC.
 - The 'run-ue' script now runs 'universalExec' and a new 'run-te' runs the Test
   Executive.  Both can optionally run the PLEXIL static checker first.
 - LUV can run either the TestExecutive (default) or UniversalExec.
 - New Plexilisp Emacs menus (courtesy of Robert Goldman at SIFT). 
 - Numerous miscellaneous fixes, enhancements, and code refactorings across the
   entire system.
 - Much revision of the reference manual.

1.0
 - Revamped source code directory structure.
 - Replaced 'jam' with 'make' as the system's build tool.
 - Added a new application IpcExec, allowing multiple communicating executives.
 - Added CMU's "IPC" system to support IpcExec, and future planned applications.
 - Numerous small fixes and enhancements throughout the system.
 CAVEATS: 
 - Standalone Simulator may not work in Mac OS and some
   versions of Linux, due to errors in the LCM library.  LCM
   is in the process of being replaced by IPC.
 - A PDF version of the user manual, normally included in the distribution, 
   is not available; we are seeking a means to create one from the new wiki
   system used by Sourceforge.


0.91
 - Deprecated Function Call node.
 - Added 'jam' executables in plexil/bin
 - Added support for testing node iteration outcome.
 - Extended Plexil: added Concurrence form; bug fixes
 - Plexilisp: added Wait, Concurrence; action forms can now contain
   nodes or node bodies; empty sequences are properly supported
 - XML schema updates
 CAVEATS: 
 - Standalone Simulator may not work in Mac OS and some versions of
   Linux, due to errors in the LCM library.  The problem is being worked on.


0.90
 - New application framework, revised external interfaces, and simple
   test application using both.  See the app-framework directory.  The
   existing external interfaces are unchanged from the previous release,
   but are deprecated.
 - Standard Plexil no longer supports hyphenated variable names. Hyphenated
   variables may be supported in a future release.
 - Standalone simulator now supports telemetry and has a test executive.
 - New Extended Plexil language: schema, translator, examples.
 - Plexilisp has several new constructs and generates Extended Plexil
 - Refactoring of Plexil schemas.
 - New enhancements and bug fixes to the Luv Viewer.
 - Top level Makefile and simplified build and installation instructions.
 - Numerous small enhancements and bug fixes throughout code base.


0.84
 - new component: a standalone simulator for PLEXIL.
 - new component: static checker for PLEXIL.
 - added global declarations (for static plan checking) to schemas and
   Plexilisp
 - additional workshop slides
 - easier setup for Plexilisp
 - misc bug fixes and enhancements


0.83
 - critical bug fix for event processing
 - the Node Priority clause has been deprecated.  It had semantic
   issues, and is not used in any known PLEXIL applications.  Multiple
   assignments to the same variable occuring simultaneously results in a
   runtime error.  At this stage, the Priority clause has only been
   removed from documentation and tests.  It is still implemented, as an
   undocumented and unsupported feature.  It may someday be removed from
   the implementation without notice.  A better solution may be designed.
 - more documentation regarding concurrency in list nodes
 - added PLEXIL workshop presentations
 - significant revision of several UE reference manual chapters
 - PDF manuals now included in distribution


0.82
 - refactored universal-exec/Exec/test,
   creating new 'bin' and 'apps' directories
 - slightly simplified installation
 - added RoboSim example application and plans
 - reduced response time to external world events
 - support for 64-bit architectures
 - numerous minor fixes and enhancements


0.81
 - new syntax and translator for simulation scripts
   (standard-plexil/plexilscript)
 - numerous minor fixes and enhancements

0.80
 - first Sourceforge release
