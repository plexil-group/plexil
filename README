Release Notes
-------------

0.80
 - first Sourceforge release

0.81
 - new syntax and translator for simulation scripts
   (standard-plexil/plexilscript)
 - numerous minor fixes and enhancements

0.82
 - refactored universal-exec/Exec/test,
   creating new 'bin' and 'apps' directories
 - slightly simplified installation
 - added RoboSim example application and plans
 - reduced response time to external world events
 - support for 64-bit architectures
 - numerous minor fixes and enhancements

0.83
 - critical bug fix for event processing
 - the Node Priority clause has been deprecated.  It had semantic
   issues, and is not used in any known PLEXIL applications.  Multiple
   assignments to the same variable occuring simultaneously results in a
   runtime error.  At this stage, the Priority clause has only been
   removed from documentation and tests.  It is still implemented, as an
   undocumented and unsupported feature.  It may someday be removed from
   the implementation without notice.  A better solution may be designed.

   existing external interfaces are unchanged from the previous release,
   but are deprecated.

   variables may be supported in a future release.
