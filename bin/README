This directory contains executables, and links to executables, used in
building and/or running the PLEXIL/UE software system.

Saxon is an XSLT processor obtained from http://saxon.sourceforge.net/.
A version that works with Plexil (saxon8.jar) is included here for
convenience, and is executed via the script saxon8.

Jam (Copyright 1993-2002 Christopher Seiwald and Perforce Software,
Inc.), a 'make' alternative, is available freely in source form at
ftp://ftp.perforce.com/jam/jam-2.5.tar.  We provide executables for
various platforms here for convenience.  They can be copied to a
location of your choice (and should be named simply 'jam'), or you can
run them directly from this directory, provided you add a 'jam' symbolic
link to the appropriate binary, and include this directory in your Unix
search path prior to building Plexil/UE.
