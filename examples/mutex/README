This directory contains a sample use of mutexes in PLEXIL.

To run the example:

 plexilc LibraryA.ple
 plexilc LibraryB.ple
 plexilc MutexExample.ple
 plexilexec -c ../dummy-config.xml -p MutexExample.plx

The Debug.cfg file in this directory reports all mutex operations, so
one can see what is happening. These settings may be useful in
troubleshooting your own applications.

Mutexes in PLEXIL can also be used with the TestExec. See
../../test/TestExec-regression-test/plans/MutexTest.ple for an
example.
