This directory contains an example of starvation (low priority commands
get run instead of a high priority one) and an equivelant plan which
does not exhibit starvation (StarvationFixedSequence.ple).

This is significant because the current resource arbiter implementation
can lead to high priority (CalculateLanding) commands to never execute
in favor of low priority ones (TakePicture, etc.).


To run the starvation demo first compile the plans:

  plexilc Simulator.ple
  plexilc Starvation.ple
  plexilc StarvationFixedSequence.ple

Then start the IPC publish/subscribe server used for inter-executive
communication:

  ipc

Next, start the simulator executive (without stopping ipc):

  plexilexec -p Simulator.plx -c simulator-config.xml 

Finally, start the starvation demo executive:

  plexilexec -p Starvation.plx -c command-config.xml 


Note that the plans use different interface configuration files.

To run the FixedSequence version of Starvation, instead run

  plexilexec -p StarvationFixedSequence.plx -c command-config.xml
