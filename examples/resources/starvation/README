This directory contains an example of starvation (low priority commands
get run instead of a high priority one) and an equivelant plan which
does not exhibit starvation (StarvationFixedSequence.ple).

This is significant because the current resource arbiter implementation
can lead to high priority (CalculateLanding) commands to never execute
in favor of low priority ones (TakePicture, etc.).

The convenience scripts run-starvation and
run-starvation-fixed-sequence run the PLEXIL Exec as a simulator,
using the Simulator.ple plan, and either Starvation.ple or
StarvationFixedSequence.ple as the resource acquirer.
