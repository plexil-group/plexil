This directory contains Plexil plans that illustrate the use of command
resources.

To run any plan (.ple file) in this directory, first compile it, e.g.

  plexilc resource1.ple

This creates resource1.plx, the compiled (Core Plexil XML) version of
the file.

Run it in the shell by typing:

   plexiltest -p resource1.plx
