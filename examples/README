This directory contains example PLEXIL plans, simulation scripts, and
multi-executive applications.

The 'basic' directory is a good place to start.  See the README there
for details.

The 'resource' directory contains plans that illustrate the use of
command resources. 

Multiple-executive examples are found in the 'multi-exec' subdirectory.
See the README there for details.

The "empty.pst" and "empty.plx" files are empty simulation scripts, used
as a default by the Test Executive.

An example "PLEXIL applications" (executive interfaced to an external
system, with plans) is found in examples/sample-app.

A more sophisticated example of a PLEXIL application, one that uses
PLEXIL to control robots in a graphical simulator, is found in
examples/robosim.

See the PLEXIL user manual (plexil.sourceforge.net, or in
plexil/docs/plexil-manual.pdf if this is a prebuilt distribution) for
more information.
