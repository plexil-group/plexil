This directory contains example PLEXIL plans and scripts.  A few of these are
explained in the PLEXIL Reference Manual:

https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/plexil/index.php?title=Example_PLEXIL_Plans

Multiple-executive examples are found in the 'multi-exec' subdirectory.

An example "PLEXIL application" (executive interfaced to an external system,
with plans), is found in plexil/src/apps/sample.

A more sophisticated example of a PLEXIL application, one that uses PLEXIL to
control robots in a graphical simulator, is found in plexil/src/apps/robosim.
