This directory contains example PLEXIL plans and scripts.  A few of these
examples are explained in the PLEXIL Reference Manual:

https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/plexil/index.php?title=Example_PLEXIL_Plans

All the example plans in the immediate directory are found in both source (.ple)
and translated (.plx) format.  They all have default simulation scripts for the
Test Executive application, and thus may be executed by entering the following
(as an example) at a Unix prompt:

 plexiltest -v -p SafeDrive.plx

See the Plexil Simulators chapter in the manual above for more information about
the TestExecutive, the 'plexiltest' command, and simulation scripts.

----

Multiple-executive examples are found in the 'multi-exec' subdirectory.  See the
README there for more information.

An example "PLEXIL application" (executive interfaced to an external system,
with plans), is found in plexil/src/apps/sample.  See the "Interfacing" chapter
for a description of how applications work.

A more sophisticated example of a PLEXIL application, one that uses PLEXIL to
control robots in a graphical simulator, is found in plexil/src/apps/robosim.
See the "RoboSim" appendix for more info.
