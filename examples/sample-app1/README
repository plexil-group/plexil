This directory contains a very simple example of a PLEXIL application.  It is
purely a refinement (no added functionality) of the example in the sister
directory 'sample-app':

 - represents the sample system as a class
 - eliminates use of C macros
 - slightly simplifies the publish/subscribe interface

Build this example by typing 'make'.

Run it by typing 'make test1' or

  plexilexec -p plans/plan1.plx


Description
-----------

A tiny system modeling a few states and commands is defined in SampleSystem.

An interface adapter, through which the Plexil executive communicates with the
system, is defined in SampleAdapter.

A simple publish/subscibe mechanism ('subscriber') provides a means of passing
data from the system to the adapter.  Realistically, the external system would
be a separate process, and some sort of inter-process communication would be
needed.  See the example application 'robosim' for such an example.

Example plans are found in the 'plans' directory.

See the Plexil Reference Manual at plexil.sourceforge.net (or provided in
plexil/doc/plexil-manual.pdf), and specifically the chapter "Interfacing", for
more information on how this all works.  The source code for InterfaceAdapter
(found in plexil/src/app-framework) contains additional documentation.
