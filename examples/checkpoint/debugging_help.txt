If you are getting 'WARNING: AdapterFactory.cc:115: AdapterFactory: unable to load module for adapter type "CheckpointAdapter"', these are the steps to follow:

Uncomment (or add) the following to Debug.cfg
:DynamicLoader:loadModule
:DynamicLoader:tryLoadFile

These allow you to see debug information from the library loader.


When you run the command that had gotten the warning, you will see a line like

[DynamicLoader:tryLoadFile] dlopen failed on file libCheckpointAdapter: libCheckpointAdapter: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

The following line will describe the error on library load time.



If it is similar to the following:

[DynamicLoader:tryLoadFile] dlopen failed on file libCheckpointAdapter.so: /home/albert/Desktop/NASA/plexil/lib/libCheckpointAdapter.so: undefined symbol: _ZN16CheckpointSystem8m_systemE

Run (replacing _ZN16CheckpointSystem8m_systemE with your undefined symbol)

echo _ZN16CheckpointSystem8m_systemE | c++filt

This will tell you which variable is involved in the error and should help narrow down the debugging.
