This directory contains an automated fuzz-like test for the Checkpoint system
It is not yet compatible with MacOS

Run the test with

./hypervisor.sh n

where n is the number of tests to run. This will create a number  processes
equal to the number of CPUS, each of which will run n tests.
This is the primary way to run the test.


To run a single thread of tests, run

./run_tests.sh x n

where n is the number of tests to run and x is any integer (used as an identifier by hypervisor.sh)


Description
-----------

single_test.sh runs plans/Test1.ple, which exercises the Checkpoint system.
Test1 is deliberately killed at some point in its execution to simulate a crash.
Then plans/Test2.ple is run, which describes what Test1 had saved to disk.

These results are passed into ParseTests.cc, which analyzes the outputs
of the two plan executions and determines if there is a discrepancy
between what Test1 said it did and what it actually did.


run_tests.sh runs single_test.sh a user-specified number of times in its
own isolated saves directory, called saves-x, created in the testing directory
and then deleted at the end of the script.

It randomly determines the time at which single_test.sh should crash Test1 (which may be not at all) then executes and single_test.sh.
This occurs a user-specified number of times


hypervisor.sh runs CPUS copies of run_tests.sh at a time in separate
saves directories and concatenates the log files.

It is the primary way to run the test.
