This directory contains a very simple example of a PLEXIL application.   

Build this example by typing 'make'.

Run the checkpoint example by typing 'make test1' or

  plexilexec -p plans/PanoramaCrashTest.plx

Run the string manipulation example by typing 'make test2' or

  plexilexec -p plans/StringOperations.plx

Description
-----------


This contains two Adapters, one for handling simple string manipulation commands
and the other for persistent plans. All files other than StringAdapter.hh and
StringAdapter.cc are used for the CheckpointAdapter

Example plans are found in the 'plans' directory.

To fully test PanoramaCrashTest, run it four times. The first two will crash,
and the second two will succeed, and each time, new checkpoints will be passed.

This README will be fleshed out in a future commit.
The adapters will be moved to more appropriate locations in a later commit.
