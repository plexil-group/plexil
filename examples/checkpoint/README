This directory contains Adapters to allow string manipulation and a Checkpoint system.   

Build this example by typing 'make'.

Run the checkpoint example by typing 'make test1' or

  plexilexec -p plans/PanoramaCrashTest.plx

Run the string manipulation example by typing 'make test2' or

  plexilexec -p plans/StringOperations.plx

Description
-----------


This contains two Adapters, one for handling simple string manipulation commands
and the other for persistent plans. All files other than StringAdapter.hh and
StringAdapter.cc are used for the CheckpointAdapter.

StringAdapter contains a number of useful string manipulation functions.
These are available as Lookups or Commands.


CheckpointAdapter allows writing persistent checkpoints such that following
a crash, its is possible to look up checkpoints set in previous boots.
For example, CheckpointState("abc",1) will return the state (set or not)
of the checkpoint named "abc" in the previous boot. The time of last modification
and an information string (user set) are also available.

Additionally, metadata about each boot, including time of boot and time of last save
are available, as is an IsOk variable which is (optionally) set to true on a safe exit.


interface-configuration.xml contains configuration details for the checkpoint adapter.
SaveConfiguration-Directory: The directory in which saves (in the form x_save.xml or x_save.part)
			     are saved.
			     Default "./saves"


AdapterConfiguration-OKOnExit: Whether IsBootOK is set to true when the executive exits normally.
			       It is not recommended to set this without also setting FlushOnExit.
			       Default "true"
			       
AdapterConfigurationn-FlushOnExit: Whether checkpoint data/IsBootOK/last_save_time is flushed
				   to disk on exit.
			       	   Default "true"
				   
AdapterConfiguration-UseTime: Whether the checkpoint system attempts to find and use a time adapter
			      This is useful since the Adapter does not know if a functioning
			      time adapter exists, and attempting to use it can lead to lower
			      performance. Other than performance, the checkpoint adapter will
			      behave the same if this is on or off when no time adapter exists.
			      Default "true"
			       


Example plans are found in the 'plans' directory.

To fully test PanoramaCrashTest, run it four times. The first two will crash,
and the second two will succeed, and each time, new checkpoints will be passed.

StringOperations exercises the StringAdapter and demonstrates its functionality.
StringOperationsLookup does the same with lookups.

The adapters will be moved to more appropriate locations in a later version.
