This directory contains relatively basic PLEXIL plans that illustrate
various features in the language.  They can be run with the Test
Executive application, a Plexil application that runs a plan using a
simulation script that models the external environment.

To run any plan (.ple file) in this directory, first compile it.  We'll
use SafeDrive.ple as an example.  To compile the file, type the
following:

  plexilc SafeDrive.ple

This creates SafeDrive.plx, the compiled (Core Plexil XML) version of
the file.

Run it in the shell by typing:

   plexiltest -p SafeDrive.plx

To run it using the graphical Plexil Viewer, add the -v option:

   plexiltest -v -p SafeDrive.plx

Some plans in this directory require simulation scripts, which are found
(automtically by 'plexiltest') in the 'scripts' subdirectory.  Those
plans that do not require a simulation script (i.e. don't interact with
an external environment) are paired with the empty script
(plexil/examples/empty.plx) when run with plexiltest.  These plans can
also be run by the Plexil Executive (substitute plexilexec for
plexiltest in the commands above).

See the PLEXIL user manual (plexil.sourceforge.net, or in
plexil/docs/plexil-manual.pdf if this is a prebuilt distribution) for
more information.
