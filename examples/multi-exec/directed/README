This is a multi-part example that displays PLEXIL's capabilities for directed
communication. There are two actors and one controller in this system. The two
actors are front_engine and rear_engine. Each engine has one lookup, Torque, and
can process one command, setTorque. The controller plan swaps the torque of the
front and rear engines.

To run these examples, simply run the run-directed script in this directory.
