This is a multi-part example that displays PLEXIL's
capabilities for directed communication. There are two actors
and one controller in this system. The two actors are
front_engine and rear_engine. Each engine has one lookup,
Torque, and can process one command, setTorque. The controller
plan swaps the torque of the front and rear engines.

To run these examples, first compile each .ple file using the
'plexil' compiler, then run these commands in seperate Unix
shells.

  ipc
  run-ue -p front_engine.plx -c front_engine-config.xml
  run-ue -p rear_engine.plx -c rear_engine-config.xml
  run-ue -p controller.plx -c controller-config.xml
