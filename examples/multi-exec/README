This directory contains several examples of PLEXIL applications that involve
multiple communicating executives.  

The 'directed' example illustrates directed communication (messaging) between
executives.

The 'simulator' example illustrates an executive acting as a simulator
(i.e. accepting commands and lookups) from another executive.

The other subdirectories are in need of some rework and/or documentation.
