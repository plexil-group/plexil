This directory contains several examples of PLEXIL applications that involve
multiple communicating executives.  See the README in each subdirectory
for more details.

The 'directed' example illustrates directed communication (messaging) between
executives.

The 'simulator' example illustrates an executive acting as a simulator
(i.e. accepting commands and lookups) from another executive.

The 'arrays' example is like 'simulator', but passes and returns arrays
in the commands.

The 'agents' example illustrates a more sophisticated interaction
between two Plexil agents.

See the PLEXIL user manual (plexil.sourceforge.net, or in
plexil/docs/plexil-manual.pdf if this is a prebuilt distribution) for
more information about multi-executive applications.
