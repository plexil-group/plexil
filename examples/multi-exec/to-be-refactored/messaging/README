Car Example (Car.ple, CarInternalSystems.ple) - 


Before Executing:

1)   If necessary, build your Plexil distribution and IPC server:
       setenv PLEXIL_HOME <full pathname for your 'plexil' directory'>
       cd $PLEXIL_HOME
       make
       make ipc

Within the IpcExec Directory:

1)   Translate CarInternalSystems.ple  into CarInternalSystems.plx
       plexil plans/CarInternalSystems.ple

2)   Translate the Car.ple into a Car.plx
       plexil plans/Car.ple

3)   Translate any other '.ple' files you wish to run.

4)   Build IpcExec
       make

Executing:

Within the IpcExec Directory:

1)   Begin the IPC Central Server
       $PLEXIL_HOME/bin/ipc

2)   Execute the CarInternalSystems plan
      ./run-ue-ipc plans/CarInternalSystems.plx

3)   Execute the Car plan
      ./run-ue-ipc plans/Car.plx

More Examples:  Follow the same steps above, substituting the following
plan/exec startup sequences for steps 2-3.


  CarInternalSystems1, Car1  (a small extension of above, adding
                              multiple concurrent messages)

  CarInternalSystems1, Heater, Car3  (two "servers", one "client")

  Vendor, Consumer           (messages with looping)


Note that Consumer is written in Plexilisp; therefore the .plx is
provided in SVN.
