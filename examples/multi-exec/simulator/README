This directory contains an example PLEXIL application consisting of two
communicating executives.  One executive (whose plan is simulator.ple)
acts as a simulator.  Another executive sends either commands or lookups
(command.ple and lookup.ple, respectively) to this simulator executive.

To run this example, first compile the plans:

  % plexil simulator.ple
  % plexil command.ple
  % plexil lookup.ple

Then start the IPC publish/subscribe server used for inter-executive
communication:

  % ipc

Next, start the simulator executive:

  % run-ue -p simulator.plx -c simulator-config.xml 

Finally, start an executive using either the command or lookup plans:

  % run-ue -p command.plx -c command-config.xml 

or 

  % run-ue -p lookup.plx -c command-config.xml 

Note that both use the same interface configuration file.
