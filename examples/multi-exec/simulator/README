This directory contains an example PLEXIL application consisting of two
communicating executives.  One executive (whose plan is Simulator.ple) acts as a
simulator.  Another executive (specified by Robot.ple) sends commands and
lookups to the simulator executive.

Specifically, the Simulator.ple plan simulates an external system that can
process one integer lookup (X), one command (MoveRight(Integer dx)), and one
message (Quit).

To run this example, first compile the plans:

  plexilc Simulator.ple
  plexilc Robot.ple

Then start the IPC publish/subscribe server used for inter-executive
communication:

  ipc

Next, start the simulator executive:

  plexilexec -p Simulator.plx -c simulator-config.xml 

Finally, start the "robot" executive:

  plexilexec -p Robot.plx -c command-config.xml 

Note that the plans use different interface configuration files.
