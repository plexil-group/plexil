This directory contains an example PLEXIL application consisting of two
communicating executives that pass arrays to each other as data.  One
executive (whose plan is simulator*.ple) acts as a simulator.  Another
executive sends commands (command*.ple) to this simulator executive.
The * in these filenames refers to the string and numeric array variants
in the actual filenames.

Use the convenience script run-arrays in this directory to run these examples:

./run-arrays numeric
  or
 ./run-arrays string
