This directory contains an example PLEXIL application consisting of two
communicating executives that pass arrays to each other as data.  One
executive (whose plan is simulator*.ple) acts as a simulator.  Another
executive sends commands (command*.ple) to this simulator executive.
The * in these filenames refers to the string and numeric array variants
in the actual filenames.

To run this example, first compile the plans (.ple files), e.g. 

  plexilc simulator-numeric-arrays-test.ple

Then start the IPC publish/subscribe server used for inter-executive
communication:

  ipc

Next, start the desired simulator executive, e.g.

  plexilexec -p simulator-numeric-arrays-test.plx -c simulator-arrays-config.xml 

Then start the corresponding commanding executive.  For the above
simulator this would be:

  plexilexec -p command-numeric-arrays-test.plx -c command-arrays-config.xml
