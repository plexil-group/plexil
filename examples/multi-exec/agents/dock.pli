  ;; The "dock" sits and waits for requests to dock from particular rovers,
  ;; and can handle multiple rovers (4 bays?, more?)
  ;;    request := rover-id[0] action(1=doc, ?=un-dock)[2] urgency(not used)[3]
  ;;   response := bay[0] rover[1] dist(ft][2] speed(ft/sec)[3] angle(deg)[4] time(sec)[5]
  ;; A "rover" requests docking information periodically until the dock responds,
  ;; after which the dock periodically broadcasts the telemetry (response) to the
  ;; rover (which it is expected follow as closely as it can).
  ;; After the rover has docked, both the rover and dock execute their own post
  ;; docking procedures, exchanging docking done message, and opening their inner
  ;; hatches.  Eventually, the rover un-docks and departs, freeing up the bay.
  ;;
  ;; The dock has N bays.  If one or more have been requested, then we loop through
  ;; the bays sending "sensed" telemetry related to the rover assigned to the bay
  ;; in question (i.e., dist, angle, speed).  Telemetry is pushed until docking is
  ;; achieved, then post-docking procedures/checks are run, finally the dock hatch
  ;; is opened.  After some time, everything is reverse, and eventually, the bay
  ;; is once again free.
