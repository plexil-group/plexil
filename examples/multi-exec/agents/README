There are two multi-executive applications in this directory, 'cmd' and
'dock'.  Their plans are written in Plexilisp, and not the standard
Plexil syntax.  The easiest way to compile and run these applications is
entering the following 'make' commands in this directory:

  make cmd
  make dock

For more information, see the files, as well as the PLEXIL user manual
(plexil.sourceforge.net, or in plexil/docs/plexil-manual.pdf if this is
a prebuilt distribution).
