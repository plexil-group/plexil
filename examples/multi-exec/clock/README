The Clock example is expected to run as an agent in a larger system.
It listens for StartClock and StopClock messages.  Upon receipt of a
StartClock message, it updates the Time telemetry value, prints the
new value, and publishes it to other agents once per second. It
continues doing this until a StopClock message is received.
