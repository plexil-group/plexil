This directory contains shell scripts useful in building and/or
running the PLEXIL/UE software system:

 - checkDecls runs the type declaration checker on a Plexil XML plan, e.g.:
  checkDecls plan.plx

 - checkreqs tests whether your system has the prerequisites needed to run Plexil.

 - debugFlagCollector.py lists all the debug flags defined in the Plexil C++ code.

 - env-info writes a summary of your environment to the $PLEXIL_HOME directory,
   under the name 'userinfo-<date>.txt'. This can be useful for reporting problems.

 - ipc runs the IPC 'central' program. 'ipc -x' runs it as a background process.

 - plexil launches the Plexil Viewer, a plan execution visualization tool.
   Plans can be run from the Viewer, or it can be used to monitor ongoing execution
   in an existing Plexil executive process.




Saxon is an XSLT processor obtained from http://saxon.sourceforge.net/.
A version that works with Plexil (saxon9he.jar) is included here for
convenience, and is executed via the script saxon-xslt.
