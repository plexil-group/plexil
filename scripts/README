This directory contains shell scripts useful in building and/or
running the PLEXIL/UE software system:

 - checkDecls runs the type declaration checker on a Plexil XML plan, e.g.:
  checkDecls plan.plx

 - checkreqs tests whether your system has the prerequisites needed to run Plexil.

 - debugFlagCollector.py lists all the debug flags defined in the Plexil C++ code.

 - eplexil translates a plan file in the Extended Plexil (.epx) format
   to Core Plexil (.plx) format.

 - env-info writes a summary of your environment to the $PLEXIL_HOME directory,
   under the name 'userinfo-<date>.txt'. This can be useful for reporting problems.

 - ipc runs the IPC 'central' program. 'ipc -x' runs it as a background process.

 - plexil launches the Plexil Viewer, a plan execution visualization tool.
   Plans can be run from the Viewer, or it can be used to monitor ongoing execution
   in an existing Plexil executive process.

 - plexil-setup.csh and plexil-setup.sh are environment setup scripts,
   for (t)csh and (ba)sh type shells respectively.
   They are meant to be sourced from the command line or by other scripts.

 - plexilc runs the Plexil compiler to convert a variety of plan and script file formats
   into their executable XML representations.

 - plexilexec runs the multi-threaded Plexil executive (formerly "universalExec").

 - plexilisp runs the Plexilisp translator, which turns a Lisp-like plan or script file
   into its executable XML representation.

 - plexilscript translates a Plexilscript simulation script into its executable XML
   representation.

 - plexilsim runs the multi-threaded Plexil executive, Standalone Simulator,
   and IPC central.

 - plexiltest runs the single-threaded Plexil executive (formerly "TestExec").

 - robosim runs the 2D robot simulator (requires IPC central).

 - run-agents runs 2 cooperating plans.

 - run-sas runs the Standalone Simulator (requires IPC central).

 - setup-android is for developer use only.

 - summarize-plexil produces a text summary of a Plexil plan.
