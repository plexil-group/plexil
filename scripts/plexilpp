# Generate a .ple (PLEXIL source) file from a .plp file (file containing PLEXIL
# source plus any C preprocessor macros).  Generates the target file in the same
# directory as the source file, overwriting any existing file.

# NOTE: Uses the standard C preprocessor (assuming found) to realize macros
# within PLEXIL.  This is a crude, though effective, approach that has been used
# on several PLEXIL projects.  One limitation is that included files must have a
# .h extension.
